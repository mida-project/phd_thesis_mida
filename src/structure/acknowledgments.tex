The acknowledgments section of a PhD thesis is a personal statement where the author expresses gratitude to those who have supported, influenced, or contributed to the completion of their doctoral research and the writing of the thesis.
This section is not just a formality but a heartfelt opportunity to recognize the assistance and encouragement received throughout the challenging journey of a PhD.
