	abstract = {Background Numerous groups have developed software applications (apps) for use by community health workers (CHWs) in hard-to-reach settings. However, these have either not been based on clinical guidelines or are not freely available. Our objectives were to (1) design and develop an app for use by CHWs; and (2) conduct preliminary testing of the app to identify potential obstacles.Methods We used the principle of human-centred design to develop an app programmed to an Android operating system. We used a mixed-methods approach which included site observations, meetings with stakeholders and the app development team, and laboratory simulation to fine tune the design. The {\textquoteleft}Mobile Application Rating Scale{\textquoteright} (MARS) was used for testing reliability and quality. We also assessed the validity of the app by matching the uploaded data with {\textquoteleft}gold standard{\textquoteright} preset answers.Results Depending on human{\textendash}computer interactions, the app has reminder, advisor, critic and guide functions which can facilitate CHWs to make clinical decisions. We found the app is usable based on the final score of the MARS tool, and that the entered data were accurate. We present the simple procedures that were followed to develop this Android app. The app, including all of its code, is freely available.Conclusion The app shows promise as a tool for the management of non-communicable disease in a rural setting in India. The next step will be to refine the app in a field setting and then to evaluate its efficacy in a large-scale clinical trial.},

    abstract = { Populationwide mammography screening has been associated with a substantial rise in false-positive mammography findings and breast cancer overdiagnosis. However, there is a lack of current data on the associated costs in the United States. We present costs due to false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses among women ages 40–59, based on expenditure data from a major US health care insurance plan for 702,154 women in the years 2011–13. The average expenditures for each false-positive mammogram, invasive breast cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ in the twelve months following diagnosis were \$852, \$51,837 and \$12,369, respectively. This translates to a national cost of \$4 billion each year. The costs associated with false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses appear to be much higher than previously documented. Screening has the potential to save lives. However, the economic impact of false-positive mammography results and breast cancer overdiagnoses must be considered in the debate about the appropriate populations for screening. }

abstract="We show two important findings on the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) in medical image analysis. First, we show that CNN models that are pre-trained using computer vision databases (e.g., Imagenet) are useful in medical image applications, despite the significant differences in image appearance. Second, we show that multiview classification is possible without the pre-registration of the input images. Rather, we use the high-level features produced by the CNNs trained in each view separately. Focusing on the classification of mammograms using craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views and their respective mass and micro-calcification segmentations of the same breast, we initially train a separate CNN model for each view and each segmentation map using an Imagenet pre-trained model. Then, using the features learned from each segmentation map and unregistered views, we train a final CNN classifier that estimates the patient's risk of developing breast cancer using the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) score. We test our methodology in two publicly available datasets (InBreast and DDSM), containing hundreds of cases, and show that it produces a volume under ROC surface of over 0.9 and an area under ROC curve (for a 2-class problem - benign and malignant) of over 0.9. In general, our approach shows state-of-the-art classification results and demonstrates a new comprehensive way of addressing this challenging classification problem.",

abstract = "Rationale and Objectives
Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed in the past two decades to assist radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lesions seen on breast imaging exams, thus providing a second opinion. Mammographic databases play an important role in the development of algorithms aiming at the detection and diagnosis of mammary lesions. However, available databases often do not take into consideration all the requirements needed for research and study purposes. This article aims to present and detail a new mammographic database.
Materials and Methods
Images were acquired at a breast center located in a university hospital (Centro Hospitalar de S. João [CHSJ], Breast Centre, Porto) with the permission of the Portuguese National Committee of Data Protection and Hospital's Ethics Committee. MammoNovation Siemens full-field digital mammography, with a solid-state detector of amorphous selenium was used.
Results
The new database—INbreast—has a total of 115 cases (410 images) from which 90 cases are from women with both breasts affected (four images per case) and 25 cases are from mastectomy patients (two images per case). Several types of lesions (masses, calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions) were included. Accurate contours made by specialists are also provided in XML format.
Conclusion
The strengths of the actually presented database—INbreast—relies on the fact that it was built with full-field digital mammograms (in opposition to digitized mammograms), it presents a wide variability of cases, and is made publicly available together with precise annotations. We believe that this database can be a reference for future works centered or related to breast cancer imaging."

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme for mass detection on digitized mammograms that achieves a high sensitivity while maintaining a low false positive (FP) rate using morphological enhancement and simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method. Methods: The authors developed a multiple stage method for breast mass detection. The proposed CAD scheme consists of five major components: (1) preprocessing based on morphological enhancement, which enhances mass-like patterns while removing unrelated background clutters, (2) segmentation of mass candidates based on the SLIC method, which groups mass and background tissue into different regions, (3) prescreening of suspicious regions using rule-based classification that eliminates regions unlikely to represent masses, (4) potential lesion contour refinement based on distance regularized level set evolution, and (5) FP reduction based on feature extraction and an ensemble of undersampled support vector machines. Two datasets were built to design and evaluate the system: a mass dataset containing 187 cases (386 mammograms) and a nonmass dataset containing 88 mammograms. All cases were acquired from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). Approximately two thirds of the available masses were used for training the system, and the remaining masses and nonmass dataset were used for testing. Results: Testing of the proposed CAD system on the mass dataset yielded a mass-based sensitivity of 98.55\%, 97.10\%, 92.75\% at 0.84, 0.63, 0.55 FP mark/image, respectively. Tested on the nonmass dataset, the scheme showed a FP rate of 0.55, 0.34, 0.30 mark/image. Conclusions: The results indicate that the system is promising in improving the performance of current CAD systems by reducing FP rate while achieving relatively high sensitivity.},

abstract = "Objective
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in detection of breast cancers.
Materials and Methods
CAD was retrospectively applied to standard mammographic views of 127 cases with biopsy proven breast cancers detected with FFDM (Senographe 2000, GE Medical Systems). CAD sensitivity was assessed in total group of 127 cases and for subgroups based on breast density, mammographic lesion type, mammographic lesion size, histopathology and mode of presentation.
Results
Overall CAD sensitivity was 91% (115 of 127 cases). There were no statistical differences (p>0.1) in CAD detection of cancers in dense breasts 90% (53/59) versus non-dense breasts 91% (62/68). There was statistical difference (p<0.05) in CAD detection of cancers that appeared mammographically as microcalcifications only versus other mammographic manifestations. CAD detected 100% (44/44) of cancers manifesting as microcalcifications, 89% (47/53) as no-calcified masses or asymmetries, 88% (14/16) as masses with associated calcifications, and 71% (10/14) as architectural distortions. CAD sensitivity for cancers 1–10mm was 84% (38/45); 11–20mm 93% (55/59); and >20mm 97% (22/23).
Conclusion
CAD applied to FFDM showed 100% sensitivity in identifying cancers manifesting as microcalcifications only and high sensitivity 86% (71/83) for other mammographic appearances of cancer. Sensitivity is influenced by lesion size. CAD in FFDM is an adjunct helping radiologist in early detection of breast cancers."

abstract = {Abstract Recent estimates of global cancer incidence and survival were used to update previous figures of limited duration prevalence to the year 2008. The number of patients with cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2008 who were still alive at the end of 2008 in the adult population is described by world region, country and the human development index. The 5-year global cancer prevalence is estimated to be 28.8 million in 2008. Close to half of the prevalence burden is in areas of very high human development that comprise only one-sixth of the world's population. Breast cancer continues to be the most prevalent cancer in the vast majority of countries globally; cervix cancer is the most prevalent cancer in much of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia and prostate cancer dominates in North America, Oceania and Northern and Western Europe. Stomach cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Eastern Asia (including China); oral cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer in Indian men and Kaposi sarcoma has the highest 5-year prevalence among men in 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The methods used to estimate point prevalence appears to give reasonable results at the global level. The figures highlight the need for long-term care targeted at managing patients with certain very frequently diagnosed cancer forms. To be of greater relevance to cancer planning, the estimation of other time-based measures of global prevalence is warranted.},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

abstract={Discriminant validity assessment has become a generally accepted prerequisite for analyzing relationships between latent variables. For variance-based structural equation modeling, such as partial least squares, the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the examination of cross-loadings are the dominant approaches for evaluating discriminant validity. By means of a simulation study, we show that these approaches do not reliably detect the lack of discriminant validity in common research situations. We therefore propose an alternative approach, based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix, to assess discriminant validity: the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations. We demonstrate its superior performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, in which we compare the new approach to the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the assessment of (partial) cross-loadings. Finally, we provide guidelines on how to handle discriminant validity issues in variance-based structural equation modeling.},

              computer-aided detection (CAD) systems on the performance of
              radiologists with digital mammograms acquired during the Digital
              Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST). MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Only those DMIST cases with proven cancer status by
              biopsy or 1-year follow-up that had available digital images were
              included in this multireader, multicase ROC study. Two
              commercially available CAD systems for digital mammography were
              used: iCAD SecondLook, version 1.4; and R2 ImageChecker Cenova,
              version 1.0. Fourteen radiologists interpreted, without and with
              CAD, a set of 300 cases (150 cancer, 150 benign or normal) on the
              iCAD SecondLook system, and 15 radiologists interpreted a
              different set of 300 cases (150 cancer, 150 benign or normal) on
              the R2 ImageChecker Cenova system. RESULTS: The average AUC was
              0.71 (95\% CI, 0.66-0.76) without and 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.67-0.77)
              with the iCAD system (p = 0.07). Similarly, the average AUC was
              0.71 (95\% CI, 0.66-0.76) without and 0.72 (95\% CI 0.67-0.77)
              with the R2 system (p = 0.08). Sensitivity and specificity
              differences without and with CAD for both systems also were not
              significant. CONCLUSION: Radiologists in our studies rarely
              changed their diagnostic decisions after the addition of CAD. The
              application of CAD had no statistically significant effect on
              radiologist AUC, sensitivity, or specificity performance with
              digital mammograms from DMIST.",

Self-efficacy is a construct that has been found useful in predicting behaviors. Measurement of self-efficacy needs to be specific to the behavior and to have good validity and reliability. The purpose of this study is to describe development of a self-efficacy instrument to measure confidence in obtaining a mammogram. Bandura's model guided item development. Construct validity was measured using confirmatory factor analysis and logistic regression. Cronbach alpha was used to test internal consistency reliability. A Cronbach alpha coefficient of .87 was obtained. The mammography self-efficacy scale evidenced content and construct validity. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 28:329–336, 2005},

The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was adapted and incorporated with attitude and hedonic performance expectancy. Two steps of structural equation modeling were used to validate the measurement model and test the hypothesized relationships. Findings The study found that utilitarian and hedonic performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions are critical determinants of US consumers' intentions to use mobile shopping services. Effort expectancy is a driving factor affecting utilitarian and hedonic performance expectancy of mobile shopping services. Further, the study found that the hedonic or entertainment aspect of mobile shopping services is the most critical driver of US consumers' intentions to use mobile shopping services.

Computer-based personal assistance can help to behave healthy by persuading and guiding older adults. For effective persuasion, the assistant should express social behaviors (e.g., turn taking, emotional expressions) to be trustworthy and show empathy. From the motivational interviewing method and synthetic assistants’ literature, we derived a set of social behaviors, and implemented a subset in a physical character, a virtual character and a text interface. The first behavior type concerns conversing with high-level dialogue (semantics, intentions), which could be implemented in all 3 assistants. The other behavior types could only be implemented in the characters: showing natural cues (e.g., gaze, posture), expressing emotions (e.g., compassionate face), and accommodating social conversations (e.g., turn taking). In an experiment, 24 older adults (45–65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a “one-week diabetics scenario”. They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters. However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better. Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface. Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character.}

At the same time, use of mobile health (mHealth) technology raises privacy and security concerns of consumers. The goal of this analysis was to understand the perceived ease of use, usefulness, risk and trust that contribute to behavioral intention to use a mobile application for meeting the healthcare needs of persons living with HIV (PLWH). To understand these issues, we conducted focus group sessions with 50 persons living with HIV and 30 HIV healthcare providers. We used the e-commerce acceptance model to analyze our focus group data. Findings from the study demonstrated the need for mHealth to be perceived as useful, easy to use, with little perceived risk accompanied by a measure of trust in the creators of the technology. Findings from this work can inform future work on patients and providers' perceptions of risk, trust, ease of use and usefulness of mHealth technology.},

It uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model with constructs of security, trust, social influence, and self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling is used to construct a predictive model of attitudes toward the mobile wallet. Individuals’ responses to questions about attitude and intention to adopt/use a mobile wallet were collected and analyzed with various factors modified from UTAUT. While the model confirms the classical role of technology acceptance factors (i.e., perceived usefulness and ease of use are key antecedents to users’ attitude), the results also show that users’ attitudes and intentions are influenced by perceived security and trust. In the extended model, the moderating effects of demographics on the relations among the variables were found to be significant. The proposed model brings together extant research on mobile payment and provides an important cluster of antecedents to eventual technology acceptance via constructs of behavioral intention to use and actual system usage.}

The results indicated that service quality is the main factor affecting trust, whereas system quality is the main factor affecting satisfaction. Information quality and service quality affect flow. Trust, flow and satisfaction determine continuance intention of mobile payment. The results imply that service providers need to offer quality system, information and services in order to facilitate users' continuance usage of mobile payment.}

abstract = {ABSTRACT Mobile payments (MPs) are predicted to be one of the future's most successful mobile services but have achieved limited acceptance in developed countries to date. PCs are still the preferred technology for online shopping in the United Kingdom but the continued growth of mobile commerce (MC) is highly correlated with the success of remote MPs (RMPs). Currently MP research has largely ignored the variations between different MP solutions, and existing MP adoption studies have predominantly utilized Davis’ (1989) Technology Acceptance Model, which has been criticized for having a deterministic approach without much consideration for users’ individual characteristics. Therefore, this study applied the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), extended with more consumer-related constructs, to explore the factors affecting nonusers’ intentions to adopt RMP in the United Kingdom. Quantitative data were collected (n = 268) and structural equation modeling was undertaken. The findings revealed that performance expectancy, social influence, innovativeness, and perceived risk significantly influenced nonusers’ intentions to adopt RMP, whereas effort expectancy did not. Inclusion of MP knowledge as a moderating variable revealed that there was a significant difference in the effect of trust on behavioral intention for those who knew about MP than for those who did not. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the development and marketing of RMP, which will support the long-term success of MC.},

 abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.}

To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

abstract = {Background
One of the most important factors for the success of health information technology (IT) implementation is users’ acceptance and use of that technology. Thailand has implemented the national universal healthcare program and has been restructuring the country's health IT system to support it. However, there is no national data available regarding the acceptance and use of health IT in many healthcare facilities, including community health centers (CHCs). This study employed a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) structural model, to understand factors that influence health IT adoption in community health centers in Thailand and to validate this extant IT adoption model in a developing country health care context.
Methods
An observational research design was employed to study CHCs’ IT adoption and use. A random sample of 1607 regionally stratified CHC's from a total of 9806 CHCs was selected. Data collection was conducted using a cross-sectional survey by means of self-administered questionnaire with an 82\% response rate. The research model was applied using the partial least squares (PLS) path modeling.
Results
The data showed that people who worked in CHCs exhibited a high degree of IT acceptance and use. The research model analyses suggest that IT acceptance is influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and voluntariness. Health IT use is predicted by previous IT experiences, intention to use the system, and facilitating conditions.
Conclusions
Health IT is pervasive and well adopted by CHCs in Thailand. The study results have implications for both health IT developmental efforts in Thailand and health informatics research. This study validated the UTAUT model in the field context of a developing country's healthcare system and demonstrated that the PLS path modeling works well in a field study and in exploratory research with a complex model.}

abstract = {Both philosophers and psychologists have argued for the existence of distinct kinds of explanations, including teleological explanations that cite functions or goals, and mechanistic explanations that cite causal mechanisms. Theories of causation, in contrast, have generally been unitary, with dominant theories focusing either on counterfactual dependence or on physical connections. This paper argues that both approaches to causation are psychologically real, with different modes of explanation promoting judgments more or less consistent with each approach. Two sets of experiments isolate the contributions of counterfactual dependence and physical connections in causal ascriptions involving events with people, artifacts, or biological traits, and manipulate whether the events are construed teleologically or mechanistically. The findings suggest that when events are construed teleologically, causal ascriptions are sensitive to counterfactual dependence and relatively insensitive to the presence of physical connections, but when events are construed mechanistically, causal ascriptions are sensitive to both counterfactual dependence and physical connections. The conclusion introduces an account of causation, an “exportable dependence theory,” that provides a way to understand the contributions of physical connections and teleology in terms of the functions of causal ascriptions.}

abstract = {Intelligibility and control are important user concerns in context-aware applications. They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications.},

abstract="In this paper we introduce the CrowdTruth open-source software framework for machine-human computation, that implements a novel approach to gathering human annotation data for a variety of media (e.g. text, image, video). The CrowdTruth approach embodied in the software captures human semantics through a pipeline of four processes: a) combining various machine processing of media in order to better understand the input content and optimize its suitability for micro-tasks, thus optimize the time and cost of the crowdsourcing process; b) providing reusable human-computing task templates to collect the maximum diversity in the human interpretation, thus collect richer human semantics; c) implementing 'disagreement metrics', i.e. CrowdTruth metrics, to support deep analysis of the quality and semantics of the crowdsourcing data; and d) providing an interface to support data and results visualization. Instead of the traditional inter-annotator agreement, we use their disagreement as a useful signal to evaluate the data quality, ambiguity and vagueness. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of this approach to a variety of problems across multiple domains. Moreover, we show the advantages of using open standards and the extensibility of the framework with new data modalities and annotation tasks.",

We have countered this assumption with CrowdTruth, and have shown that it can be better suited to tasks for which semantic interpretation is subjective. In this paper we investigate the dependence of worker metrics for detecting spam on the quality of sentences in the dataset, and the quality of the target semantics.

The goal of the DSP was to provide an introduction to AI-ML through a flexible schedule of educational, experiential and research activities. We describe our initial experience with the DSP tailored to the AI-ML interests of three senior radiology residents. We discuss logistics and curricular design with common core elements and shared mentorship. Residents were provided dedicated, full-time immersion into the CCDS work environment. In the initial DSP pilot, residents were successfully integrated into AI-ML projects at CCDS. Residents were exposed to all aspects of AI-ML application development, including data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Core concepts in AI-ML were taught through didactic sessions and daily collaboration with data scientists and other staff. Work during the pilot period led to twelve accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings. The DSP is a feasible, well-rounded introductory experience in AI-ML for senior radiology residents. Residents contributed to model and tool development at multiple stages and were academically productive. Feedback from the pilot resulted in establishment of a formal AI-ML curriculum for future residents. The logistical, planning, and curricular considerations we describe provide a framework for DSP implementation at other institutions.},

Workers may not be amenable to working with a robotic co-worker due to a negative perception of the technology. The attitudes of workers towards automation are influenced by a variety of complex and multi-faceted factors such as intention to use, perceived usefulness and other external variables [15]. In an analog manufacturing environment, we explore how these various factors influence an individual's willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker in a collaborative Lego building task. We specifically explore how this willingness is affected by: 1) the level of social rapport established between the individual and his or her human co-worker, 2) the anthropomorphic qualities of the robot, and 3) factors including trust, fluency and personality traits. Our results show that a participant's willingness to work with automation decreased due to lower perceived team fluency (p=0.045), rapport established between a participant and their co-worker (p=0.003), the gender of the participant being male (p=0.041), and a higher inherent trust in people (p=0.018).},

Accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor is an important task in medical diagnosis. Machine learning techniques are gaining importance in medical diagnosis because of their classification capability. In this paper, we propose a new, Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) algorithm, for solving classification problems. We evolve a neural network genetically to optimize its architecture (structure and weight) for classification. We introduce new crossover and mutation operators which differ from standard crossover and mutation operators to reduce the destructive nature of these operators. We use the GONN algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. To demonstrate our results, we had taken the WBCD database from UCI Machine Learning repository and compared the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, ROC curves and AUC under ROC curves of GONN with classical model and classical back propagation model. Our algorithm gives classification accuracy of 98.24%, 99.63% and 100% for 50–50, 60–40, 70–30 training–testing partition respectively and 100% for 10 fold cross validation. The results show that our approach works well with the breast cancer database and can be a good alternative to the well-known machine learning methods."

abstract="Background: Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices. Methods: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care--related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R2=0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; P<.001), perceived usefulness (beta=.336; P=.03), and resistance bias (beta=--.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=--.095; P=.049) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use. Conclusions: The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should therefore avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products. ",

abstract="Background: For the majority of preterm infants, the last weeks of hospital admission mainly concerns tube feeding and establishment of breastfeeding. Neonatal home care (NH) was developed to allow infants to remain at home for tube feeding and establishment of breastfeeding with regular home visits from neonatal nurses. For hospitals covering large regions, home visits may be challenging, time consuming, and expensive and alternative approaches must be explored. Objective: To identify parental needs when wanting to provide neonatal home care supported by telemedicine. Methods: The study used participatory design and qualitative methods. Data were collected from observational studies, individual interviews, and focus group interviews. Two neonatal units participated. One unit was experienced in providing neonatal home care with home visits, and the other planned to offer neonatal home care with telemedicine support. A total of 9 parents with preterm infants assigned to a neonatal home care program and 10 parents with preterm infants admitted to a neonatal unit participated in individual interviews and focus group interviews, respectively. Results: Three overall themes were identified: being a family, parent self-efficacy, and nurse-provided security. Parents expressed desire for the following: (1) a telemedicine device to serve as a ``bell cord'' to the neonatal unit, giving 24-hour access to nurses, (2) video-conferencing to provide security at home, (3) timely written email communication with the neonatal unit, and (4) an online knowledge base on preterm infant care, breastfeeding, and nutrition. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of neonatal home care. NH provides parents with a feeling of being a family, supports their self-efficacy, and gives them a feeling of security when combined with nursing guidance. Parents did not request hands-on support for infant care, but instead expressed a need for communication and guidance, which could be met using telemedicine. ",

abstract="Background: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed. Objective: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Results: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.

A platform exhibits network effects if, the more that people use it, the more valuable it becomes to each user. Theorizing about the value perceived by users of a platform that exhibits network effects has traditionally focused on direct and indirect network effects. In this paper, we theorize about a new category of network effects—data network effects—that has emerged from advances in artificial intelligence and the growing availability of data. A platform exhibits data network effects if, the more that the platform learns from the data it collects on users, the more valuable the platform becomes to each user. We argue that there is a positive direct relationship between the artificial intelligence capability of a platform and the value perceived in the platform by its users—a relationship that is moderated by platform legitimation, data stewardship, and user-centric design. }

Results: Effort expectancy ($\beta$ = 0.201, p < 0.05) and social influence ($\beta$ = 0.574, p < 0.05) were positively associated with initial trust, while no association was found between performance expectancy and initial trust (p > 0.05). Only social influence ($\beta$ = 0.527, p < 0.05) was positively related to the behavioral intention. Conclusions: This study highlights positive behavioral intentions in using an AI-based diagnosis support system among prospective Vietnamese physicians, as well as the effect of social influence on this choice.

ABSTRACT={Medical imaging has evolved from a pure visualization tool to representing a primary source of analytic approaches toward in vivo disease characterization. Hybrid imaging is an integral part of this approach, as it provides complementary visual and quantitative information in the form of morphological and functional insights into the living body. As such, non-invasive imaging modalities no longer provide images only, but data, as stated recently by pioneers in the field. Today, such information, together with other, non-imaging medical data creates highly heterogeneous data sets that underpin the concept of medical big data. While the exponential growth of medical big data challenges their processing, they inherently contain information that benefits a patient-centric personalized healthcare. Novel machine learning approaches combined with high-performance distributed cloud computing technologies help explore medical big data. Such exploration and subsequent generation of knowledge require a profound understanding of the technical challenges. These challenges increase in complexity when employing hybrid, aka dual- or even multi-modality image data as input to big data repositories. This paper provides a general insight into medical big data analysis in light of the use of hybrid imaging information. First, hybrid imaging is introduced (see further contributions to this special Research Topic), also in the context of medical big data, then the technological background of machine learning as well as state-of-the-art distributed cloud computing technologies are presented, followed by the discussion of data preservation and data sharing trends. Joint data exploration endeavors in the context of in vivo radiomics and hybrid imaging will be presented. Standardization challenges of imaging protocol, delineation, feature engineering, and machine learning evaluation will be detailed. Last, the paper will provide an outlook into the future role of hybrid imaging in view of personalized medicine, whereby a focus will be given to the derivation of prediction models as part of clinical decision support systems, to which machine learning approaches and hybrid imaging can be anchored.}

ABSTRACT={Scale development and validation are critical to much of the work in the health, social, and behavioral sciences. However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.}

abstract={There are 2.2 million cases of tuberculosis (TB) in India, with an economic burden of {\$}3 billion per year. Efficient monitoring of TB treatment is critical and the Indian Government's current reliance on a pen and paper system for monitoring patients' adherence to treatment is neither effective nor scalable. Employing the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model (UTAUT) as its theoretical foundation, this study investigates the factors influencing the acceptance and use of a mobile-based IT solution for TB treatment monitoring. Data was collected from a survey of healthcare professionals working in TB treatment clinics and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. Four constructs in the UTAUT model, effort expectancy (EE), facilitating conditions (FC), performance expectancy (PE) and social influence (SI) -- were found to significantly and positively influence healthcare professionals' behavioral intention to use the proposed mobile-based IT solution, and explained 56{\%} of the variance. Importantly, our study validates the predictive capabilities of the UTAUT model in public health service delivery context in a developing country.},

abstract="Enormous advances in the domain of statistical machine learning, the availability of large amounts of training data, and increasing computing power have made Artificial Intelligence (AI) very successful. For certain tasks, algorithms can even achieve performance beyond the human level. Unfortunately, the most powerful methods suffer from the fact that it is difficult to explain why a certain result was achieved on the one hand, and that they lack robustness on the other. Our most powerful machine learning models are very sensitive to even small changes. Perturbations in the input data can have a dramatic impact on the output and lead to entirely different results. This is of great importance in virtually all critical domains where we suffer from low data quality, i.e. we do not have the expected i.i.d. data. Therefore, the use of AI in domains that impact human life (agriculture, climate, health, ...) has led to an increased demand for trustworthy AI. Explainability is now even mandatory due to regulatory requirements in sensitive domains such as medicine, which requires traceability, transparency and interpretability capabilities. One possible step to make AI more robust is to combine statistical learning with knowledge representations. For certain tasks, it can be advantageous to use a human in the loop. A human expert can - sometimes, of course not always - bring experience, domain knowledge and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline. Such approaches are not only a solution from a legal point of view, but in many application areas the ``why'' is often more important than a pure classification result. Consequently, both explainability and robustness can promote reliability and trust and ensure that humans remain in control, thus complementing human intelligence with artificial intelligence.",

abstract = "Background
There is significant institutional variation in the surgical care of breast cancer, and this may reflect access to services and resultant physician practice patterns. In previous studies, specialty care has been associated with variation in the operative treatment of breast cancer but has not been evaluated in a community setting. This study investigates these issues in a cohort of 59 community hospitals in the United States.
Materials and methods
Data on patients receiving an operation for breast cancer (2006-2009) in a large, geographically diverse cohort of hospitals were obtained. Administrative data, autoabstracted cancer-specific variables from free text, and multiple other data sets were combined. Polymotous logistic regression with multilevel outcomes identified associations between these variables and surgical treatment.
Results
At 59 community hospitals, 4766 patients underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy, or mastectomy with reconstruction. The older patients were most likely to receive mastectomy alone, whereas the younger age group underwent more reconstruction (age <50), and BCS was most likely in patients aged 50-65. Surgical procedure also varied according to tumor characteristics. BCS was more likely at smaller hospitals, those with ambulatory surgery centers, and those located in nonmetropolitan areas. The likelihood of reconstruction doubled when there were more reconstructive surgeons in the health services area (P = 0.02). BCS was more likely when radiation oncology services were available within the hospital or network (P = 0.04).
Conclusions
Interpretation of these results for practice redesign is not straightforward. Although access to specialty care is statistically associated with type of breast surgical procedure, clinical impact is limited. It may be more effective to target other aspects of care to ensure each patient receives treatment consistent with her individual preferences."

The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer has incorporated documentation of critical elements outlined in Operative Standards for Cancer Surgery into revised standards for cancer center accreditation. This study assessed the current documentation of critical elements in partial mastectomy (PM) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) operative reports.
Materials and methods
Operative reports for PM + SLNB at a single academic institution from 2013 to 2018 were reviewed for compliance and surveyor interobserver reliability with the Oncologic Elements of Operative Record defined in Operative Standards and compared with a nonredundant American Society of Breast Surgeons Mastery of Breast Surgery (MBS) quality measure for specimen orientation.
Results
Ten reviewers each evaluated 66 PM + SLNB operative reports for 13 Oncologic Elements and one MBS measure. No operative records reported all critical elements for PM + SLNB or PM alone. Residents completed 36.4% of operative reports: Element documentation was similar for PM but varied significantly for SLNB between resident and attending authorship. Combined reporting performance and interrater reliability varied across all elements and was highest for the use of SLNB tracer (97.1% and κ = 0.95, respectively) and lowest for intraoperative assessment of SLNB (30.6%, κ = 0.43). MBS specimen orientation had both high proportion reported (87.0%) and interrater reliability (κ = 0.84).
Conclusions
Adherence to reporting critical elements for PM and SLNB varied. Whether differential compliance was tied to discrepancies in documentation or reviewer abstraction, clarification of synoptic choices may improve reporting consistency. Evolving techniques or technologies will require continuous appraisal of mandated reporting for breast surgery."

abstract = {Summary Acromegaly is a chronic disorder usually diagnosed late in the disease evolution. Such delayed diagnosis, together with the inability to achieve the treatment goals of normalizing biochemical disease markers and controlling tumour mass may result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) are accepted as first-line medical therapy or as second-line therapy in patients undergoing unsuccessful surgery and are considered a cornerstone in the treatment of acromegaly. However, because a high percentage of patients experience SSA medical treatment failure, the identification of biomarkers associated with a successful or unsuccessful response to all classes of medical therapy would help in the choice of treatment and potentially allow for a quicker normalization of biochemical parameters. The current treatment algorithms for acromegaly are based upon a “trial-and-error” approach with additional treatment options provided when disease is not controlled. In many other diseases, therapeutic algorithms have been evolving towards personalized treatment with the medication that best matches individual disease characteristics, using biomarkers that identify therapeutic response. Additionally, a personalized approach to complementary treatment of comorbidities present in the acromegalic patient is also required. This review will discuss the development of a potential treatment algorithm for acromegaly addressing the biochemical control of the disease as well of its associated comorbidities, under a personalized approach based upon markers of prognostic and predictive significance, such as tumour size, MRI adenoma signal, GH value after acute octreotide test, granular adenoma pattern, Ki-67, somatostatin receptor phenotype, aryl hydrocarbon-interacting protein expression, gsp mutations, RAF kinase activity, E-cadherin and beta-arrestin-1.},

Surgical Data Science (SDS) is a new research field that aims to improve the quality of interventional healthcare through the capture, organization, analysis and modeling of data. While an increasing number of data-driven approaches and clinical applications have been studied in the fields of radiological and clinical data science, translational success stories are still lacking in surgery. In this publication, we shed light on the underlying reasons and provide a roadmap for future advances in the field. Based on an international workshop involving leading researchers in the field of SDS, we review current practice, key achievements and initiatives as well as available standards and tools for a number of topics relevant to the field, namely (1) infrastructure for data acquisition, storage and access in the presence of regulatory constraints, (2) data annotation and sharing and (3) data analytics. We further complement this technical perspective with (4) a review of currently available SDS products and the translational progress from academia and (5) a roadmap for faster clinical translation and exploitation of the full potential of SDS, based on an international multi-round Delphi process.}

abstract={Although anaesthesiologists strive to avoid hypoxaemia during surgery, reliably predicting future intraoperative hypoxaemia is not possible at present. Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15{\%} of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30{\%}, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.},

ABSTRACT = {The herpesvirus, polyomavirus, papillomavirus, and retrovirus families are associated with breast cancer. More effort is needed to assess the role of these viruses in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer cases in women. The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient segmentation and classification system in the Mammography Image Analysis Society (MIAS) images of medical images. Segmentation became challenging for medical images because they are not illuminated in the correct way. The role of segmentation is essential in concern with detecting syndromes in human. This research work is on the segmentation of medical images based on intuitionistic possibilistic fuzzy c-mean (IPFCM) clustering. Intuitionist fuzzy c-mean (IFCM) and possibilistic fuzzy c-mean (PFCM) algorithms are hybridised to deal with problems of fuzzy c-mean. The introduced clustering methodology, in this article, retains the positive points of PFCM which helps to overcome the problem of the coincident clusters, thus the noise and less sensitivity to the outlier. The IPFCM improves the fundamentals of fuzzy c-mean by using intuitionist fuzzy sets. For the clustering of mammogram images for breast cancer detector of abnormal images, IPFCM technique has been applied. The proposed method has been compared with other available fuzzy clustering methods to prove the efficacy of the proposed approach. We compared support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), rough set data analysis (RSDA) and Fuzzy-SVM classification algorithms for achieving an optimal classification result. The outcomes of the studies show that the proposed approach is highly effective with clustering and also with classification of breast cancer. The performance average segmentation accuracy for MIAS images with different noise level 5%, 7% and 9% of IPFCM is 91.25%, 87.50% and 85.30% accordingly. The average classification accuracy rates of the methods (Otsu, Fuzzy c-mean, IFCM, PFCM and IPFCM) for Fuzzy-SVM are 79.69%, 92.19%, 93.13%, 95.00%, and 98.85%, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Precision medical technologies have received a great deal of attention, but promoting such technologies remains a problem for enterprises and medical institutions. Adopting the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and the health belief model (HBM), this study investigated the key factors affecting users&rsquo; willingness to adopt precision medicine (PM) in terms of technical factors and external stimuli. Based on 415 questionnaires, performance expectancy, price value, social influence, and perceived threat of disease were found to significantly increase users willingness to adopt PM; meanwhile, privacy risks had the opposite effect. Knowledge about PM was found to strengthen the positive effect of performance expectancy, price value, social influence, and perceived threat of disease on willingness to adopt PM and weaken the negative effect of privacy risk. This study demonstrates the successful application of UTAUT to the medical field while also providing guidance for the promotion of PM.},

ABSTRACT = {AI-assisted decision-making that impacts individuals raises critical questions about transparency and fairness in artificial intelligence (AI). Much research has highlighted the reciprocal relationships between the transparency/explanation and fairness in AI-assisted decision-making. Thus, considering their impact on user trust or perceived fairness simultaneously benefits responsible use of socio-technical AI systems, but currently receives little attention. In this paper, we investigate the effects of AI explanations and fairness on human-AI trust and perceived fairness, respectively, in specific AI-based decision-making scenarios. A user study simulating AI-assisted decision-making in two health insurance and medical treatment decision-making scenarios provided important insights. Due to the global pandemic and restrictions thereof, the user studies were conducted as online surveys. From the participant&rsquo;s trust perspective, fairness was found to affect user trust only under the condition of a low fairness level, with the low fairness level reducing user trust. However, adding explanations helped users increase their trust in AI-assisted decision-making. From the perspective of perceived fairness, our work found that low levels of introduced fairness decreased users&rsquo; perceptions of fairness, while high levels of introduced fairness increased users&rsquo; perceptions of fairness. The addition of explanations definitely increased the perception of fairness. Furthermore, we found that application scenarios influenced trust and perceptions of fairness. The results show that the use of AI explanations and fairness statements in AI applications is complex: we need to consider not only the type of explanations and the degree of fairness introduced, but also the scenarios in which AI-assisted decision-making is used.},

Workforce issues are a key factor in productivity and capacity, particularly in light of the aging of the population and the possible expansion of the target age group. The purpose of this paper is to provide a snapshot of the demographics and current working practices of radiographers currently employed by BreastScreen Australia. Methods: A questionnaire was distributed to radiographers employed in BreastScreen Australia Services. This paper reports on responses to questions relating to demographics and current working practices. Results: Two hundred and fifty three questionnaires were returned. Of radiographers within Australian BreastScreen programmes 53\% are over 50 years old, 69\% were trained in Australia and have been undertaking mammography for 10 years or more. Radiographers under 35 years old make up 12\% of the current workforce. Of the BreastScreen workforce, 63\% are employed part time. Conclusion: An estimated 78\% response rate implies that the data obtained from Australian radiographers currently working in BreastScreen is representative. Within the next five to ten years it is estimated that 30\% of BreastScreen radiographers may retire. Strategies are needed to increase workforce numbers, in order to cope with increased participation rates due to population growth and an increased target age range.},

abstract = "Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in medical image enhancement problems, such as super-resolution or image synthesis. However, to date, most existing approaches are based on deterministic models, neglecting the presence of different sources of uncertainty in such problems. Here we introduce methods to characterise different components of uncertainty, and demonstrate the ideas using diffusion MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we propose to account for intrinsic uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model and for parameter uncertainty through approximate Bayesian inference, and integrate the two to quantify predictive uncertainty over the output image. Moreover, we introduce a method to propagate the predictive uncertainty on a multi-channelled image to derived scalar parameters, and separately quantify the effects of intrinsic and parameter uncertainty therein. The methods are evaluated for super-resolution of two different signal representations of diffusion MR images—Diffusion Tensor images and Mean Apparent Propagator MRI—and their derived quantities such as mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, on multiple datasets of both healthy and pathological human brains. Results highlight three key potential benefits of modelling uncertainty for improving the safety of DL-based image enhancement systems. Firstly, modelling uncertainty improves the predictive performance even when test data departs from training data (“out-of-distribution” datasets). Secondly, the predictive uncertainty highly correlates with reconstruction errors, and is therefore capable of detecting predictive “failures”. Results on both healthy subjects and patients with brain glioma or multiple sclerosis demonstrate that such an uncertainty measure enables subject-specific and voxel-wise risk assessment of the super-resolved images that can be accounted for in subsequent analysis. Thirdly, we show that the method for decomposing predictive uncertainty into its independent sources provides high-level “explanations” for the model performance by separately quantifying how much uncertainty arises from the inherent difficulty of the task or the limited training examples. The introduced concepts of uncertainty modelling extend naturally to many other imaging modalities and data enhancement applications."

Physicians often need uptodate, reliable and with easy access information for clinical decisions evidence based medicine (EBM) databases can be a suitable approach to meet this need. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, use and factors affecting the acceptance of EBM and its databases by Iranian medical residents using UTAUT model.
Method
The present research is an applied survey, the population of which consisted of 192 medical residents of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBUMS) in Iran. A questionnaire was used for collecting data and SPSS software was used for data analysis.
Results
The results show that the total average score of assistants (range = 1–5), 2.99 and 2.73 scores were respectively obtained for the awareness and use of EBM databases. The study of factors affecting the acceptance using UTAUT showed that item "performance expectancy" with an average of 3.02 is the most important factor in the acceptance of EBM databases by medical residents and items "effort expectancy", "facilitating conditions" and "social influence" are in their next ranks with an average score of 2.54, 2.45 and 2.14, respectively.
Conclusion
The findings of this study showed that the majority of medical residents do not have sufficient awareness and knowledge about concepts of EBM and still not comprehend the necessity of using EBM databases. Therefore, planning for accepting and teaching Evidence based medicine and databases is essential.}

Accuracy of sleep stage scoring was validated in 70 subjects assessed by six scorers. The best model performed better than any individual scorer (87{\%} versus consensus). It also reliably scores sleep down to 5 s instead of 30{\thinspace}s scoring epochs. A T1N marker based on unusual sleep stage overlaps achieved a specificity of 96{\%} and a sensitivity of 91{\%}, validated in independent datasets. Addition of HLA-DQB1*06:02 typing increased specificity to 99{\%}. Our method can reduce time spent in sleep clinics and automates T1N diagnosis.

abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer types among women worldwide. If not treated in earlier stages, it may be fatal. Therefore early diagnosis of breast cancer can minimize the human life risk. Mammograms and ultrasound imaging technologies play a crucial role to detect intraductal papillomas. However, the determination process of intraductal papillomas requires histopathological image analysis which may be mostly time-consuming, subjective, and tedious if carried out manually by the experts. To cover issue, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems came into consideration. However, earlier CAD systems could not achieve significant improvement in the diagnosis process and their usage of them did not become widespread for more than a decade. Since deep learning has made so many significant advances in a wide variety of image applications, CAD systems that use its principles perform as well as the experts in stand-alone mode, and even perform better when used in support mode. In this chapter, we utilized various deep learning architectures for the detection process of breast cancer on the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) dataset which is one of the most popular and remarkable datasets in this field. According to the results, the pretrained VGG16 and MobileNet architectures obtain the best detection performance, reaching nearly 92% classification accuracy.}

abstract = {Radiomics – the high-throughput computation of quantitative image features extracted from medical imaging modalities- can be used to aid clinical decision support systems in order to build diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive models, which could ultimately improve personalized management based on individual characteristics. Various tools for radiomic features extraction are available, and the field gained a substantial scientific momentum for standardization and validation. Radiomics analysis of molecular imaging is expected to provide more comprehensive description of tissues than that of currently used parameters. We here review the workflow of radiomics, the challenges the field currently faces, and its potential for inclusion in clinical decision support systems to maximize disease characterization, and to improve clinical decision-making. We also present guidelines for standardization and implementation of radiomics in order to facilitate its transition to clinical use.}

Reviewing literature from the CSCW Journal and related conferences where CSCW work is published, we reflect on the contributions that have emerged from this work. The analysis illustrates a rich range of concepts and findings towards understanding the work of healthcare but the work on the larger policy level is lacking. We argue that this presents a number of challenges for CSCW research moving forward: in having a greater impact on larger-scale health IT projects; broadening the scope of settings and perspectives that are studied; and reflecting on the relevance of the traditional methods in this field - namely workplace studies - to meet these challenges.},

abstract = {The brain disorders may cause loss of some critical functions such as thinking, speech, and movement. So, the early detection of brain diseases may help to get the timely best treatment. One of the conventional methods used to diagnose these disorders is the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. Manual diagnosis of brain abnormalities is time-consuming and difficult to perceive the minute changes in the MRI images, especially in the early stages of abnormalities. Proper selection of the features and classifiers to obtain the highest performance is a challenging task. Hence, deep learning models have been widely used for medical image analysis over the past few years. In this study, we have employed the AlexNet, Vgg-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 pre-trained models to automatically classify MR images in to normal, cerebrovascular, neoplastic, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases classes. We have also compared their classification performance with pre-trained models, which are the state-of-art architectures. We have obtained the best classification accuracy of 95.23\% ± 0.6 with the ResNet-50 model among the five pre-trained models. Our model is ready to be tested with huge MRI images of brain abnormalities. The outcome of the model will also help the clinicians to validate their findings after manual reading of the MRI images.}

abstract="Background: Patient monitoring is indispensable in any operating room to follow the patient's current health state based on measured physiological parameters. Reducing workload helps to free cognitive resources and thus influences human performance, which ultimately improves the quality of care. Among the many methods available to assess perceived workload, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) provides the most widely accepted tool. However, only few studies have investigated the validity of the NASA-TLX in the health care sector. Objective: This study aimed to validate a modified version of the raw NASA-TLX in patient monitoring tasks by investigating its correspondence with expected lower and higher workload situations and its robustness against nonworkload-related covariates. This defines criterion validity. Methods: In this pooled analysis, we evaluated raw NASA-TLX scores collected after performing patient monitoring tasks in four different investigator-initiated, computer-based, prospective, multicenter studies. All of them were conducted in three hospitals with a high standard of care in central Europe. In these already published studies, we compared conventional patient monitoring with two newly developed situation awareness--oriented monitoring technologies called Visual Patient and Visual Clot. The participants were resident and staff anesthesia and intensive care physicians, and nurse anesthetists with completed specialization qualification. We analyzed the raw NASA-TLX scores by fitting mixed linear regression models and univariate models with different covariates. Results: We assessed a total of 1160 raw NASA-TLX questionnaires after performing specific patient monitoring tasks. Good test performance and higher self-rated diagnostic confidence correlated significantly with lower raw NASA-TLX scores and the subscores (all P<.001). Staff physicians rated significantly lower workload scores than residents (P=.001), whereas nurse anesthetists did not show any difference in the same comparison (P=.83). Standardized distraction resulted in higher rated total raw NASA-TLX scores (P<.001) and subscores. There was no gender difference regarding perceived workload (P=.26). The new visualization technologies Visual Patient and Visual Clot resulted in significantly lower total raw NASA-TLX scores and all subscores, including high self-rated performance, when compared with conventional monitoring (all P<.001). Conclusions: This study validated a modified raw NASA-TLX questionnaire for patient monitoring tasks. The scores obtained correctly represented the assumed influences of the examined covariates on the perceived workload. We reported high criterion validity. The NASA-TLX questionnaire appears to be a reliable tool for measuring subjective workload. Further research should focus on its applicability in a clinical setting. ",

abstract="Background: Despite the unprecedented performance of deep learning algorithms in clinical domains, full reviews of algorithmic predictions by human experts remain mandatory. Under these circumstances, artificial intelligence (AI) models are primarily designed as clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). However, from the perspective of clinical practitioners, the lack of clinical interpretability and user-centered interfaces hinders the adoption of these AI systems in practice. Objective: This study aims to develop an AI-based CDSS for assisting polysomnographic technicians in reviewing AI-predicted sleep staging results. This study proposed and evaluated a CDSS that provides clinically sound explanations for AI predictions in a user-centered manner. Methods: Our study is based on a user-centered design framework for developing explanations in a CDSS that identifies why explanations are needed, what information should be contained in explanations, and how explanations can be provided in the CDSS. We conducted user interviews, user observation sessions, and an iterative design process to identify three key aspects for designing explanations in the CDSS. After constructing the CDSS, the tool was evaluated to investigate how the CDSS explanations helped technicians. We measured the accuracy of sleep staging and interrater reliability with macro-F1 and Cohen $\kappa$ scores to assess quantitative improvements after our tool was adopted. We assessed qualitative improvements through participant interviews that established how participants perceived and used the tool. Results: The user study revealed that technicians desire explanations that are relevant to key electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns for sleep staging when assessing the correctness of AI predictions. Here, technicians wanted explanations that could be used to evaluate whether the AI models properly locate and use these patterns during prediction. On the basis of this, information that is closely related to sleep EEG patterns was formulated for the AI models. In the iterative design phase, we developed a different visualization strategy for each pattern based on how technicians interpreted the EEG recordings with these patterns during their workflows. Our evaluation study on 9 polysomnographic technicians quantitatively and qualitatively investigated the helpfulness of the tool. For technicians with <5 years of work experience, their quantitative sleep staging performance improved significantly from 56.75 to 60.59 with a P value of .05. Qualitatively, participants reported that the information provided effectively supported them, and they could develop notable adoption strategies for the tool. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that formulating clinical explanations for automated predictions using the information in the AI with a user-centered design process is an effective strategy for developing a CDSS for sleep staging.

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective: This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods: We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results: A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions: Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians' experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality and population data were sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) database, and age-standardized mortality rates were calculated using the standard world population. Changes in mortality trends were analyzed using Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software. RESULTS: The majority of analyzed countries showed a meaningful decrease in BC mortality among women aged 45+. However, the results of our study suggest that there are 4 EU countries - Croatia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia - where increasing BC mortality trends started to be visible in the analyzed age group. Currently, the observed increase is still not significant, but the obtained data suggest the possibility of further continuation of the observed trend in the future. Moreover, in Bulgaria we also noted continuation of the increase in BC mortality (statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the availability of better treatment options, as well as presence of effective tools for detecting BC at the early stages of progression, BC mortality is falling in most analyzed European countries. To maintain this situation and to stop BC mortality increase in the analyzed age group in Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, immediate actions for improvement of BC management in the European health care systems should be considered.},

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the benefits of an artificial intelligence (AI)–based tool for two-dimensional mammography in the breast cancer detection process. Materials and Methods In this multireader, multicase retrospective study, 14 radiologists assessed a dataset of 240 digital mammography images, acquired between 2013 and 2106, using a counterbalance design in which half of the dataset was read without AI and the other half with the help of AI during a first session and vice versa during a second session, which was separated from the first by a washout period. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints. Results The average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95\% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95\% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95\% CI: 0.002, 0.055, P = .035). Average sensitivity was increased by 0.033 when using AI support (P = .021). Reading time changed dependently to the AI-tool score. For low likelihood of malignancy (< 2.5\%), the time was about the same in the first reading session and slightly decreased in the second reading session. For higher likelihood of malignancy, the reading time was on average increased with the use of AI. Conclusion This clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.

abstract = {Entity Resolution (ER) seeks to understand which records refer to the same entity (e.g., matching products sold on multiple websites). The sheer number of ways humans represent and misrepresent information about real-world entities makes ER a challenging problem. Deep Learning (DL) has provided impressive results in the field of natural language processing, thus recent works started exploring DL approaches to the ER problem, with encouraging results. However, we are still far from understanding why and when these approaches work in the ER setting. We are developing a methodology, Mojito, to produce explainable interpretations of the output of DL models for the ER task. Our methodology is based on LIME, a popular tool for producing prediction explanations for generic classification tasks. In this paper we report our first experiences in interpreting recent DL models for the ER task. Our results demonstrate the importance of explanations in the DL space, and suggest that, when assessing performance of DL algorithms for ER, accuracy alone may not be sufficient to demonstrate generality and reproducibility in a production environment.},

  abstract = {Telemedicine uses telecommunications technology as a tool to deliver health care to populations with limited access to care. Telemedicine has been tested in multiple clinical settings, demonstrating at least equivalency to in-person care and high levels of patient and health professional satisfaction. Teleoncology has been demonstrated to improve access to care and decrease health care costs. Teleconsultations may take place in a synchronous, asynchronous, or blended format. Examples of successful teleoncology applications include cancer telegenetics, bundling of cancer-related teleapplications, remote chemotherapy supervision, symptom management, survivorship care, palliative care, and approaches to increase access to cancer clinical trials. Telepathology is critical to cancer care and may be accomplished synchronously and asynchronously for both cytology and tissue diagnoses. Mobile applications support symptom management, lifestyle modification, and medication adherence as a tool for home-based care. Telemedicine can support the oncologist with access to interactive tele-education. Teleoncology practice should maintain in-person professional standards, including documentation integrated into the patient’s electronic health record. Telemedicine training is essential to facilitate rapport, maximize engagement, and conduct an accurate virtual exam. With the appropriate attachments, the only limitation to the virtual exam is palpation. The national telehealth resource centers can provide interested clinicians with the latest information on telemedicine reimbursement, parity, and practice. To experience the gains of teleoncology, appropriate training, education, as well as paying close attention to gaps, such as those inherent in the digital divide, are essential.},

abstract={Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposome---a combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing lifestyle-related diseases.},

    abstract = "{Medical errors have a significant impact on patient care, worker safety, and health care finances. Breast imaging has the most common cause of organ-related misdiagnosis subject to malpractice suits. In order to effectively develop strategies to prevent errors, breast imaging radiologists must first understand the underlying causes of the errors that occur in the breast imaging setting. Errors in breast imaging can be related to errors in interpretation, improper workup of imaging findings, procedural errors, or errors in communication to the patient or other medical staff. The Yorkshire contributory factors framework was developed to identify factors that contribute to the errors in a hospital setting and can be adapted for use in the breast imaging setting. Within this framework, active failures refer to errors that directly affect the patient. Active errors include slips (including biases), lapses, and mistakes. The framework describes how active errors often result from factors that occur uphill from these active errors at different levels within the system. Once error causes are understood, there are concrete strategies and tools that breast imaging radiologists can implement to decrease adverse events, reduce medical errors, and promote a safety environment in the breast imaging clinic. Error mitigation tools can be summarized using the acronym SAFE, which includes support the team, ask questions, focus on a task, and effectively communicate/ensure equipment optimization/safe environment. Knowledge of errors commonly seen in a breast imaging clinic represent an opportunity for constructive changes and, ultimately, improved health care delivery.}",

Our sample consisted of 4,040 adults representative of the United States in terms of age, income, and education, but equally split among White/Caucasian (50\%) and Black/African American (50\%) respondents. We found that functional and communicative health literacy and trust in doctor have linear and curvilinear relationships with anxiety when consulting a doctor. Health numeracy had no effect. Anxiety when consulting a doctor was associated with a lower number of physician consultations and lower SWB. We observed direct linear effects of health literacy, health numeracy, and trust in doctor on frequency of physician consultations and SWB, as well as some curvilinear effects. We found a negative relationship between health numeracy and SWB. We discuss implications of these findings for health and public policy.},

Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the awareness of AI among Korean doctors and to assess physicians' attitudes toward the medical application of AI. Methods: We conducted an online survey composed of 11 closed-ended questions using Google Forms. The survey consisted of questions regarding the recognition of and attitudes toward AI, the development direction of AI in medicine, and the possible risks of using AI in the medical field. Results: A total of 669 participants completed the survey. Only 40 (5.9{\%}) answered that they had good familiarity with AI. However, most participants considered AI useful in the medical field (558/669, 83.4{\%} agreement). The advantage of using AI was seen as the ability to analyze vast amounts of high-quality, clinically relevant data in real time. Respondents agreed that the area of medicine in which AI would be most useful is disease diagnosis (558/669, 83.4{\%} agreement). One possible problem cited by the participants was that AI would not be able to assist in unexpected situations owing to inadequate information (196/669, 29.3{\%}). Less than half of the participants(294/669, 43.9{\%}) agreed that AI is diagnostically superior to human doctors. Only 237 (35.4{\%}) answered that they agreed that AI could replace them in their jobs. Conclusions: This study suggests that Korean doctors and medical students have favorable attitudes toward AI in the medical field. The majority of physicians surveyed believed that AI will not replace their roles in the future. ",

We use a patient safety perspective to reflect on the development of a computerized cancer risk assessment tool embedded within a UK primary care electronic health record system.METHODSWe developed a computerized version of the CAncer Prevention in ExetER studies risk assessment tool, in compliance with the European Union's Medical Device Regulations. The process of building this tool afforded an opportunity to reflect on clinical concerns and whether current regulations for medical devices are fit for purpose. We identified concerns for patient safety and developed nine practical recommendations to mitigate these concerns.RESULTSWe noted that medical device regulations (1) were initially created for hardware devices rather than software, (2) offer one-shot approval rather than supporting iterative innovation and learning, (3) are biased toward loss-transfer approaches that attempt to manage the fallout of harm instead of mitigating hazards becoming harmful, and (4) are biased toward known hazards, despite unknown hazards being an expected consequence of health care as a complex adaptive system. Our nine recommendations focus on embedding less-reductionist and stronger system perspectives into regulations and standards.CONCLUSIONOur intention is to share our experience to support research-led collaborative development of health informatics solutions in cancer. We argue that regulations in the European Union do not sufficiently address the complexity of healthcare information systems with consequences for patient safety. Future standards and regulations should continue to follow a system-based approach to risk, safety, and accident avoidance. }

abstract = "Rational and Objectives
Image reporting is a vital component of patient management depending on individual radiologists' performance. Our objective was to explore mammographic diagnostic efficacy in a country where breast cancer screening does not exist.
Materials and Methods
Two mammographic test sets were used: a typical screening (TS) and high-difficulty (HD) test set. Nonscreening (NS) radiologists (n = 11) read both test sets, while 52 and 49 screening radiologists read the TS and HD test sets, respectively. The screening radiologists were classified into two groups: a less experienced (LE) group with ≤5 years' experience and a more experienced (ME) group with ≥5 years' experience. A Kruskal–Wallis and Tukey–Kramer post hoc test were used to compare reading performance among reader groups, and the Wilcoxon matched pairs tests was used to compare TS and ND test sets for the NS radiologists.
Results
Across the three reader groups, there were significant differences in case sensitivity (χ2 [2] = 9.4, P = .008), specificity (χ2 [2] = 10.3, P = .006), location sensitivity (χ2 [2] = 19.8, P < .001), receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve (χ2 [2] = 19.7, P < .001) and jack-knife free-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROCs) (χ2 [2] = 18.1, P < .001). NS performance for all measured scores was significantly lower than those for the ME readers (P < .006), while only location sensitivity was lower (χ2 [2] = 17.5, P = .026) for the NS compared to the LE group. No other significant differences were observed.
Conclusion
Large variations in mammographic performance exist between radiologists from screening and nonscreening countries."

In this paper, we propose a novel metastatic cancer image classification model based on DenseNet Block, which can effectively identify metastatic cancer in small image patches taken from larger digital pathology scans. We evaluate the proposed approach to the slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset. The dataset is the slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset provided by Kaggle competition, which packs the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection into a straight-forward binary image classification task. The experiments indicated that our model outperformed other classical methods like Resnet34, Vgg19. Moreover, we also conducted data augmentation experiment and study the relationship between Batches processed and loss value during the training and validation process.}

abstract={Computerized clinical decision support systems, or CDSS, represent a paradigm shift in healthcare today. CDSS are used to augment clinicians in their complex decision-making processes. Since their first use in the 1980s, CDSS have seen a rapid evolution. They are now commonly administered through electronic medical records and other computerized clinical workflows, which has been facilitated by increasing global adoption of electronic medical records with advanced capabilities. Despite these advances, there remain unknowns regarding the effect CDSS have on the providers who use them, patient outcomes, and costs. There have been numerous published examples in the past decade(s) of CDSS success stories, but notable setbacks have also shown us that CDSS are not without risks. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art overview on the use of clinical decision support systems in medicine, including the different types, current use cases with proven efficacy, common pitfalls, and potential harms. We conclude with evidence-based recommendations for minimizing risk in CDSS design, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance.},

As a result, there has been a surge of interest and research towards user acceptance of AI technology in recent years. However, the existing research appears dispersed and lacks systematic synthesis, limiting our understanding of user acceptance of AI technologies. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and meta-Analysis guidelines using five databases: EBSCO host, Embase, Inspec (Engineering Village host), Scopus, and Web of Science. Papers were required to focus on both user acceptance and AI technology. Acceptance was defined as the behavioural intention or willingness to use, buy, or try a good or service. A total of 7912 articles were identified in the database search. Sixty articles were included in the review. Most studies (n = 31) did not define AI in their papers, and 38 studies did not define AI for their participants. The extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was the most frequently used theory to assess user acceptance of AI technologies. Perceived usefulness, performance expectancy, attitudes, trust, and effort expectancy significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, willingness, and use behaviour of AI across multiple industries. However, in some cultural scenarios, it appears that the need for human contact cannot be replicated or replaced by AI, no matter the perceived usefulness or perceived ease of use. Given that most of the methodological approaches present in the literature have relied on self-reported data, further research using naturalistic methods is needed to validate the theoretical model/s that best predict the adoption of AI technologies.}

In this paper, I investigate the relation between explanation and trust in the context of computing science. This analysis draws on literature study and concept analysis, using elements from system theory as well as actor-network theory. I apply the conceptual framework to both AI and information security, and show the benefit of the framework for both fields by means of examples. The main focus is on expert systems (AI) and electronic voting systems (security). Finally, I discuss consequences of the analysis for ethics in terms of (un)informed consent and dissent, and the associated division of responsibilities.},

We hold out the full dataset from a seventh hospital for testing to assess the algorithm's ability to generalize to new sites. Our classifiers are convolutional neural networks that take multiple input images from a mammography study and produce classifications for the study. The studies are globally labeled as normal, biopsy benign, high risk or biopsy malignant. We report on experimental results from several network variants, including study-level and breast-level models, single- and multiple-output models, and a novel model architecture that incorporates prior studies. Each model variation includes an image-level classifier that is pre-trained with per-image labels and is used as a feature extractor in our study-level models. Our best study-level model achieves 0.85 area under the ROC curve for normal vs malignant classification on the held-out test site. In comparison with other recent work, we achieve a similar level of classification sensitivity and specificity on a dataset with greater site and vendor variation. Additionally, our test performance is demonstrated on a held-out site to more accurately assess how the model would perform when deployed in the field.",
