Until now, this thesis explored the factors influencing the acceptance and adoption of \ac{AI} systems (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap004}), where we found enough evidence for the needs of different user groups.
Then, we delved into designing interventions (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap005}) to enhance the acceptance and integration of \ac{AI} systems in healthcare settings.
In this chapter, our focus shifts to understanding how \ac{AI} systems should communicate to address the specific needs and characteristics of different user groups~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3580682}, particularly considering the professional experience of the clinician.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:chap006001}

\ac{AI} systems, driven by \ac{DL} techniques, hold promise for various healthcare applications~\cite{CALISTO2022102285, Hannun2019, Ruamviboonsuk2019, Stephansen2018}.
However, these systems often fail to capture the variability among clinicians, such as interns, juniors, middles, and seniors~\cite{Uddin2019}.
Integrating technological advancements in the clinical workflow, such as \ac{AI} systems, can potentially advance personalized and precision medicine~\cite{Subramanian2020, HO2020497, Wetzstein2020}.
Consequently, understanding how \ac{AI} systems should communicate (Figure~\ref{fig:fig097}), considering the professional experience of the clinician (Section~\ref{sec:chap004006001} of Chapter~\ref{chap:chap004}), becomes a crucial design question~\cite{pacheco2019alignment}.

This study explores the application of the BreastScreening-AI framework in two conditions: conventional and assertiveness-based agents~\cite{pacheco2019alignment, 10.1145/3311350.3347162}.
By serving as a second reader, the intelligent agents aim to enhance diagnostic performance, reduce \acp{FP} and \acp{FN} (Over-Diagnosis {\it vs} Under-Diagnosis), and improve the efficiency and efficacy of the clinical workflow~\cite{CALISTO2022102285, 10.1145/3311350.3347162}.
While much research has focused on improving the accuracy of \ac{AI} algorithms, there is a necessity to address the adoption (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap004}) and usability (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap005}) concerns of interactive assistance techniques.
This study sheds light on clinicians' needs, practices, and attitudes toward \ac{AI}-powered assistance, emphasizing the importance of personalized communication and explanations to foster trust and acceptance of \ac{AI} systems~\cite{10.1145/3491102.3502104, CALISTO2021102607}.

Through a within-subject study involving 52 clinicians, our research examines the interaction between conventional and assertiveness-based agents in diagnosing a dataset of 289 patients~\cite{PELAU2021106855}.
The assertiveness-based agent utilizes different communication tones while providing human-interpretable clinical arguments to explain the \ac{AI} algorithms' diagnostic outputs~\cite{HANCER2023321}.
This integration of \ac{DL} methods into communication theories allows us to explore the impact of assertiveness-based \ac{AI} mediation on clinicians with varying expertise levels, specifically addressing critical medical decision-making scenarios~\cite{Aldoj2020, 8721151}.
The findings from our study contribute to computational interaction approaches, providing valuable insights into the design of interactive systems underpinned by computational principles for the \ac{HCI} community, particularly in high-stakes domains.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:chap006002}

Medical imaging systems enable end-users to diagnose various modalities, including \ac{MG}, \ac{US}, and \ac{MRI}, through seamless data retrieval~\cite{faraji2019radiologic}.
Integrating these modalities presents opportunities for quantitative imaging and diagnoses, necessitating specialized data handling, post-processing, and visualization methods~\cite{Igarashi:2016:IVS:2984511.2984537}.
In the clinical domain, medical imaging tools aid experts in making better decisions, such as identifying cancer prognostics from multi-modal data~\cite{IBRAHIM2019438, Tan2023}.
This chapter focuses on understanding different aspects and expectations of a \ac{CDSSe} integrated into the radiology workflow, highlighting the enhancement of medical imaging diagnosis through assertiveness-based interaction.

In the context of \ac{HAII}, intelligent agents must go beyond providing results alone and consider user behaviors during decision-making~\cite{10.1145/3313831.3376807}.
In Section~\ref{sec:app005003001} of Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}, we delve deeper into this \ac{HAII} literature.
Additionally, we explore the interdisciplinary topic of \ac{XAI}, which intersects cognitive psychology, learnability, and context awareness within the field of \ac{HCI}~\cite{doi:10.1073/pnas.1618211113, doi:10.1080/07370024.2021.1977128}.
Learnability, an essential aspect of usability, encompasses various aspects such as hints, guidance, and visualizations when designing \ac{XAI} systems\cite{10.1145/1753326.1753552, 10.1145/3173574.3174156}.
Furthermore, explainable context awareness simplifies context representation, providing users with information about the obtained data and system actions~\cite{10.1145/3313831.3376545, 10.1145/1518701.1518832}.

\ac{HAII} incorporates human feedback in model training to create better \ac{ML} models~\cite{10.1145/3290605.3300233, 10.1145/3132272.3134111, Kocielnik:2019:YAI:3290605.3300641, aha2017ai}, where we bring the topic focusing on personalized and customized \ac{AI} suggestions tailored to varying levels of medical expertise (Section~\ref{sec:app005003001}).
Researchers emphasize the importance of explaining \ac{AI} systems' reasoning to enhance \ac{HAII}, particularly in medical domains, where the interpretability of \ac{AI} predictions is crucial~\cite{10.1145/3411764.3445717, Rudin2022, Kawamleh2022, Lundberg2018}.
However, these approaches often fail to account for cognitive bias in decision-making, which varies among individuals with different levels of expertise and knowledge~\cite{https://doi.org/10.1111/nuf.12430, Seidel2021}.
Our work addresses these gaps by studying assertiveness-based communication in \ac{AI} systems, considering expertise levels to reduce cognitive bias.

The integration of \ac{AI} systems into clinical decision-making is a complex endeavor (Section~\ref{sec:app005003002} of Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}), as it presents challenges and unintended consequences~\cite{burr2018analysis, miller2019intrinsically}.
Critical decisions related to patient safety, clinician fatigue, and increased medical errors need to be carefully addressed~\cite{10.1093/jamia/ocab291, 10.1117/12.2613082, doi:10.1148/radiol.212631}.
Clinicians often find \ac{AI} systems challenging to use due to limited technical skills and a lack of customization to their behavioral aspects~\cite{CALISTO2022102922}.
Additionally, the understanding and communication of \ac{AI} outcomes to clinicians are hindered by poorly designed interfaces.
These interfaces often fail to consider the differences in clinician characteristics during decision-making, such as the varying reasoning approaches between novice and expert clinicians~\cite{Edgar2022}.

The lack of large-scale deployment of \ac{AI} systems in healthcare further complicates the understanding of how these systems are perceived and used in real-world settings~\cite{10.1145/3411764.3445432, SU202328, ZAPPATORE20231}.
While approaches such as \ac{iML}~\cite{10.1145/604045.604056}, \ac{HITL}~\cite{holzinger2016interactive, 10.1145/3397481.3450668}, human-\ac{AI} symbiosis~\cite{JARRAHI2018577}, and human-\ac{AI} collaboration~\cite{10.1145/3411764.3445432} have been proposed in \ac{HCI}, they primarily focus on improving prediction accuracy, model efficiency, and interpretability without adequately considering the burden on healthcare professionals~\cite{10.1145/3555157, 10.1145/3209889.3209897}.
Existing studies on the perception and usage of \ac{AI} systems for clinical decision-making often overlook potential differences in behavioral reasoning.
Additionally, some approaches solely prioritize accurate algorithmic suggestions without accounting for the clinician's professional medical experience~\cite{10.1145/3491102.3502104}.
A more detailed literature review concerning these topics is further described in Section~\ref{sec:app005003002} of Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}.
Our research bridges the gaps between \ac{HCI} and \ac{AI} approaches, focusing on personalized and customized algorithmic suggestions based on varying levels of medical expertise.
These approaches empower clinicians, improves decision-making, and enhances patient care outcomes.

\acp{CDSSe} have greatly benefited from \ac{DL} algorithms~\cite{esteva2019guide} in various applications (Section~\ref{sec:app005003003} of Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}).
\ac{DL} systems have demonstrated their ability to detect patterns, make predictions, and assist clinicians in high-stakes decision-making processes~\cite{10.1145/3555157}, such as skin cancer diagnosis~\cite{esteva2017dermatologist}, cardiac \ac{MRI} segmentation~\cite{8759179}, and breast cancer detection~\cite{MAICAS2019101562}.
These models have shown exceptional performance in identifying meaningful patterns within medical data, sometimes surpassing human capabilities~\cite{wang2019deep}.
However, there is a need to adapt the communication tone of \acp{CDSSe} for personalized and customized medicine~\cite{MAICAS2019101562, CALISTO2022102285}, considering the unique behavioral characteristics and expertise levels of clinicians.
While \ac{DL}-based \acp{CDSSe} have shown promising results~\cite{mckinney2020international, Rajpurkar2022, MAIERHEIN2022102306}, there are challenges in translating them from research and development environments to real clinical settings.

Utility to clinicians and logistical hurdles are common obstacles in clinical adoption~\cite{Elwyn2013, Musen2021}, and some systems have not effectively reduced clinician workload~\cite{KOHLI2018535} or improved diagnostic accuracy~\cite{Cole2014fi, KOHLI2018535}.
\ac{HCI} research in clinical environments has explored the evaluation of interactive \ac{DL} systems from a human-centered perspective~\cite{10.1145/3311957.3359433, 10.1145/3359206, Fitzpatrick2013, 10.1145/3538882.3542790}.
Studies have investigated techniques to enhance diagnostic utility and user trust in \ac{DL} predictions, as well as identified important information for clinicians when integrating \ac{AI} assistants into routine practice~\cite{10.1145/3290605.3300234, 10.1145/3359206}.
However, these studies (Section~\ref{sec:app005003003}) have yet to consider the heterogeneous behavioral nature of decision-making among clinicians.

Trust plays a critical role in communication (Section~\ref{sec:app005003004} of Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}), especially in clinical environments where life-altering decisions are made~\cite{Amann2020}.
Positive motivational attribution and reducing ambiguity through trust~\cite{HOHENSTEIN2020106190} are key factors in successful collaboration between humans and \ac{AI}~\cite{10.1145/3479587, 10.1145/3334480.3375147, 10.1145/3334480.3382842}.
The impact of assertiveness-based \ac{AI} mediation on novice and expert clinicians is still not well understood~\cite{Lundberg2020, 10.1145/1518701.1518832}.
Understanding the effects of \ac{AI} communication is vital to avoid unforeseen clinical consequences.
Trust directly influences clinicians' perception of \ac{AI} outcomes and their attitudes, satisfaction, and performance evaluations~\cite{10.1145/3491102.3502104}.
Attribution theory and external cues shape clinicians' interpretation of information~\cite{LOMBROZO2010303}.
Our work introduces assertive communication theories into a deep learning system and clinical scenario, offering a novel approach to address these dynamics.

\section{Assertiveness-based System}
\label{sec:chap006003}

In this chapter, we explore how human-\ac{AI} interactions are affected by the ability of an \ac{AI} agent to not only incorporate granular patient information from the \ac{AI} outputs but also exploring how to adapt the communication tone ({\it i.e.}, more assertive or suggestive) depending on the medical experience ({\it i.e.}, novice or expert) of the clinician.
Specifically, we compare the \ac{AI} outputs (Figure~\ref{fig:fig096}) that explain to clinicians some clinical arguments with more granular information about the patient regarding the lesion details, to a conventional agent that only provides numeric estimates ({\it e.g.}, BIRADS and accuracy) of the classification.
Further details are described in Section~\ref{sec:app005004} of Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure}[htpb]

\includegraphics[width=1.000\textwidth]{fig096}
\caption[]{Interface for conventional and assertiveness-based AI agents for medical imaging analysis. Attributes are associated with numbers in each condition.

\label{fig:fig096}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Our assertiveness-based agent uses recommendations for classifying and segmenting:
(1) the number of detected findings;
(2) the patient severity of each breast and per medical imaging modality;
(3) a visual scale representing the benign or malign estimates;
(4) providing visualization of the sensitivity and specificity outcomes of the models; and
(5) with clinical arguments of the patient, such as pathological co-variables.
To compare the assertiveness-based agent to the conventional agent, we inform participants that the recommendations are generated by our AI models, so that they can also provide some feedback concerning the model performance.

Figure~\ref{fig:fig096} illustrates how the two AI agents were integrated into an existing medical workflow for the classification of medical imaging data on the support of breast cancer diagnosis.
Both agents are recommending classification and segmentation based on the DenseNet model~\cite{8721151} for MG and US, as well as based on the ResNet model~\cite{TALO2019101673} for MRI.
The two AI agents provided the severity classification of the patient via BIRADS~\cite{SPAK2017179}, the accuracy of the model for that classification, and the segmentation of the lesion to explain the regions that derived from that classification.

\section{Research Questions \& Hypotheses}
\label{sec:chap006004}

TODO (15/06/2023): shorten this section...

The final purpose of our research is twofold.
Through assertiveness-based agents, we first aim to understand how personalized and customized communication could affect medical assessments in terms of the efficiency and efficacy of the clinical workflow.
Secondly, we aim to understand how clinicians perceive assertiveness-based agents differently.
Thus, our work addresses two primary research questions concerning the impact of assertiveness-based agents on efficiency and efficacy (RQ1), as well as the perception (RQ2) of clinicians.

\noindent
Specifically, we consider the following research questions and related hypotheses:

\vspace{0.5mm}

% New RQs
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf RQ1.} How does an assertiveness-based agent affect medical assessments?
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf H1.1.} Efficiency of clinicians in terms of time performance per each diagnosed patient will be higher with an assertiveness-based agent.
\item {\bf H1.2.} Classification accuracy of clinicians will not suffer with an assertiveness-based agent.
% For the H1.3., we have two options:
% In the following H1.3., we will need to say earlier that the personalized explanations are the levels ({\it i.e.}, more or less assertive) of the assertiveness-based communication. So that we can stay aligned with the paper (https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376506) that motivated this work.
\item {\bf H1.3.} Through assertiveness-based communication, accuracy differences between novice and expert clinicians will depend on the tone of the personalized explanations.
% Here, we will be direct to the point. However, we will not be inline of the inspired literature (https://doi.org/10.1145/3313831.3376506) which is motivating this work.
% \item {\bf H1.3.} Differences in accuracy between novice or expert clinicians will depend on the levels ({\it i.e.}, more or less assertive communication) of the assertiveness-based agent.
\end{itemize}
\item {\bf RQ2.} How is an assertiveness-based agent perceived by clinicians?
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf H2.1.} Clinicians will have a preference for an assertiveness-based agent.
\item {\bf H2.2.} Clinicians will consider an assertiveness-based agent more trustworthy.
\item {\bf H2.3.} Personalized highlights and explanations will not increase clinicians' workload nor decrease usability.
\item {\bf H2.4.} Novice and expert clinicians will perceive reliability and capability differently, depending on the levels of assertiveness.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In real-world clinical settings, time of clinicians is a limited and expensive resource that should be reallocated efficiently.
We take the position that while clinicians should make their clinical assessments with care, AI agents can help on the diagnosis efficiency.
Our assertiveness-based agent is designed to summarize the recommendations, and to provide clinical arguments explaining the underlying classification and segmentation of the AI models.

For RQ1, our protection is that personalized and customized explanations can inform clinical decision-making.
Therefore, it will increase clinicians' classification accuracy without reducing their time performance over diagnosis.
Especially, we envision that adapting the communication of the personalized explanations is crucial for successfully informing decision-making of clinicians.

The HCI research community has settled that poor user perception can be a barrier to adoption of technology regardless of performance~\cite{10.1145/3313831.3376506, 10.1145/3479549, 10.1145/3434073.3444649}.
In fact, the user perceptions of preference and trust are essential in predicting technology adoption~\cite{10.1145/3434073.3444649}.
Hence, it is important to investigate clinicians' perception, as we do in RQ2.
Beyond the primary outcome in terms of reliability in AI-assisted clinical assessments, our goal is also to understand how assertiveness-based agents are perceived by clinicians.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:chap006005}

As a way to improve clinical decision-making, the goal of our study is to attain a deeper understanding of personalized and customized mechanisms, exploring how to adapt the communication of agents depending on the medical experience of clinicians.
Our study draws from 52 semi-structured interviews and user testing with clinicians for breast cancer detection via medical imaging diagnosis.
To accomplish this goal, we conducted a two-condition study, within-subjects, counterbalanced experiment, in which each subject participated in three trials, providing us with rich information to analyze.

Interviews were conducted from March 2022 to June 2022.
Research questions were fused from these interviews and observations, thanks to the support of user-centered activities, such as workshops, focus groups, affinity diagramming, data clustering, and prototype co-design, leading us to reported problems.
Participants in these sessions include clinicians from different healthcare institutions, researchers from the ML field, and HCI researchers.
Before the work commenced, the study was approved by the ethics committee of each clinical institution.
Next, we describe the details of our controlled experiment including the task, dataset, information of participants, study procedures, and statistical analysis.

\subsection{Task}
\label{sec:chap006005001}

We conducted our study in the field of imaging classification on breast cancer, a clinical domain with typically high False-Positive rates to over-diagnose a patient~\cite{KIM2020e138, doi:10.1377/hlthaff.2014.1087}.
In particular, we compared our conventional and assertiveness-based agents in the context of assisting trained medical personnel in the task of a breast cancer diagnosis.
For the conventional condition, we used the {\it BreastScreening-AI} framework~\cite{CALISTO2022102285} publicly available (\href{https://mida-project.github.io/prototype-multi-modality-assistant/}{git.io/JMjDi}) and built for the development of medical assistants.
Aside from the already available functionalities of this framework, we developed two conditions for testing our hypothesis from a post-hoc analyses concerning how to personalize and customize the AI outcomes to clinicians.
We raised several trials, from a more suggestive (non-assertive) to a more assertive tone of the AI recommendations, where clinicians with different levels of expertise are interacting with both trials and the conventional.
In the end, all clinicians interacted with one conventional, one non-assertive, and one assertive agent.
Each clinician diagnosed three patients with different severities, where the task was to {\it accept} or {\it reject} the AI recommendations.

There are two groups of clinicians with different medical professional experiences:
(a) novice; and
(b) expert.
Patients are divided into three groups of breast severities:
(i) low severity, representing the BIRADS of 1, meaning there are no findings for that patient and both breasts are healthy;
(ii) medium severity, representing the BIRADS of 2 and 3, meaning there are some findings with higher probability of benign suspicious; and
(iii) high severity, representing the BIRADS of 4 and 5, meaning there are findings with higher probability of malign suspicious.
Usually, each patient has available three types of modalities ({\it i.e.}, MG, US, and MRI).
For this task, clinicians need to read six imaging views approximately per each patient:
(1) one CC-L;
(2) one CC-R;
(3) one MLO-L;
(4) one MLO-R;
(5) one US; and
(6) one DCE-MRI volume with between 100 and 200 frames.
Shortly, clinicians participated as readers while assessing each patient in terms of the likelihood and location of the malignancy.

During the task of responding to the lesion localization, the reader clinician provides the severity classification of the clinical argument for that suspicious attribute on the image.
For each image, the clinician classifies the patient final severity assessment via BIRADS classification by default.
Meaning that, although the patient has some clinical arguments ({\it e.g.}, group microcalcifications with diffuse distribution in Figure~\ref{fig:fig098}) pointing to a BIRADS of 2, if there is a suspicious irregular shape mass with spiculated margin, by default the clinician will consider the final BIRADS as a 5.

The task of diagnosing breast cancer involves reading heterogeneous appearances, ranging from obvious masses with spiculated margins to subtle asymmetric or faint microcalcifications~\cite{Sturesdotter2020}.
This leads to difficulties for clinicians in achieving an accurate diagnosis and consistent interpretation of the patient.
Because of that, clinicians apply rules from radiological guidelines to classify breast images based on visually inspecting the patterns on the image~\cite{doi:10.1148/radiol.2020192534}.

The classification of breast cancer via the BIRADS scale lends itself to a task for our study on AI agents in medical imaging assessments.
Not only the task is a time-consuming and tedious procedure for clinicians, but also relies on non-trivial classification tasks.
Indeed, the prior medical literature has established that the medical error of clinicians has between 50\% and 30\% chance of being a false-positive and about 10\% chance of being a false-negative~\cite{10.1093/jbi/wbaa118}.

\subsection{Dataset}
\label{sec:chap006005002}

In this paper, we used a total of 338 cases acquired in the first hospital (Section~\ref{sec:chap006005003}).
From this set of cases (Section~\ref{sec:app001002}), 289 were classified by the head of radiology.
Each patient has several images concerning four X-ray mammography (two in CC and two MLO views), one ultrasound image to train the DenseNet model, and roughly DCE-MRI images in MRI to train the ResNet model.
In the MRI volumes, we take several image slices per patient, where the lesion is present.
This provides us roughly 2890 images ({\it i.e.}, 289~\texttimes~(4 + 1 + 5)), that are used to train/test the AI models.

Traditional image processing and deep learning techniques require extensive pre-processing~\cite{Zhong_2020}.
As a matter of fact, it is known that a cleaning dataset is welcome when training a deep neural network~\cite{RIASATIAN2021102032}.
In our study, this stage is of the utmost importance, since the MG, US, and MR images contain quite different intensities and the images are of different sizes.
Thus, before introducing the images to the DenseNet and ResNet models, we pre-process the data (Section~\ref{sec:app001006}).
Specifically, we perform data normalization, so that the images have the same intensity, regardless of the modality.

All the images are resized to 224x224 pixels.
The images are normalized by subtracting their mean and dividing by their standard deviation.
The above size is used since the DenseNet model is prepared to receive the input with this format.

\subsection{Participants}
\label{sec:chap006005003}

We recruited 52 clinicians as participants for our study on a volunteer basis from a broad range of clinical environments, including different health institutions (public hospitals, cancer institutes, and private clinics).
Our clinicians were recruited through the already established protocols under this study from 11 different clinical institutions: (1) \href{https://hff.min-saude.pt}{Hospital Prof. Dr. Fernando Fonseca (HFF)}; (2) \href{https://www.ipolisboa.min-saude.pt}{Instituto Portugu\^{e}s de Oncologia (IPO) de Lisboa (IPO-Lisboa)}; (3) \href{https://www.chln.min-saude.pt}{Hospital de Santa Maria (HSM)}; (4) \href{http://www.ipocoimbra.min-saude.pt}{IPO de Coimbra (IPO-Coimbra)}; (5) \href{http://www.madeiramedicalcenter.pt}{Madeira Medical Center (MMC)}; (6) \href{https://www.sams.pt}{ServiÃ§os de Assist\^{e}ncia M\'{e}dico-Social do Sindicato dos Banc\'{a}rios do Sul e Ilhas (SAMS)}; (7) \href{http://www.chbm.min-saude.pt}{Hospital do Barreiro (HB)}; (8) \href{https://www.chporto.pt}{Hospital de Santo Ant\'{o}nio (HSA)}; (9) \href{https://www.fchampalimaud.org/}{Champalimaud Foundation (CF)}; (10) \href{https://www.chtmad.min-saude.pt/}{Centro Hospitalar De Tr\'{a}s-Os-Montes E Alto Douro, E.P.E.

All clinicians and clinical institutions gave prior permission to use their data for research purposes under this study.

From the demographic questionnaires (Section~\ref{sec:app001003}), 55.77\% of participants are expert clinicians, whereas 34.62\% are seniors having more than 10 years of practical experience, and 21.15\% are middle clinicians having more than 5 years but less than 10 years.
Similarly, 44.23\% of participants are novice clinicians, whereas 32.69\% are juniors after taking the exam, having up to 5 years of clinical experience, and 11.54\% are interns before the medical specialty exam.
Each clinician was exposed to the three trials ({\it i.e.}, conventional, assertive, and non-assertive) in a counter-balanced manner.

\subsection{Procedure}
\label{sec:chap006005004}

After providing an informed consent form for participation in the study, each clinician reported information concerning several self-characteristics.
First, they reported their demographic characteristics (Section~\ref{sec:app001003}).
Second, they reported their professional backgrounds, such as clinical education ({\it i.e.}, radiology, surgery, nurse, technician, etc), areas of expertise, work sector, and medical experience.
Finally, information about their experience while reading medical imaging data.
Next, clinicians familiarized themselves for about 3 minutes with our user interface and with the basic functionalities common to both AI agents.

At this stage, each participant interacted with the assistant, {\it accepting} or {\it rejecting} the system suggestion in the two different conditions: (a) conventional; and (b) assertiveness-based.
The set of patients was providing participants 289 patients, while all patients must have at least one of the three available modalities.
Each participant open the set of three patients ({\it e.g.}, {\bf P1}, {\bf P2} or {\bf P3}), chosen randomly, and examined it.
During the examination, the participant interacts with the available functionalities of the system.

Clinicians performed the same task of diagnosing three patients twice, once with the conventional agent and another time with the assertiveness-based agent.
For each task, clinicians were asked to read the suggested AI recommendations, where the task ends when clinicians {\it accept} or {\it reject} the proposed BIRADS.
Additionally, clinicians could ask for a visual {\it explanation} inside the image during the task.
The list of patients was fully classified by the AI models, and clinicians could revise the explanations (bounding boxes 2 and 4 of Figure~\ref{fig:fig096}) for the important regions to consider.

After each task, clinicians filled out a brief feedback questionnaire exploring their perception of each AI agent.
The questionnaire included scales to measure three dimensions of trust~\cite{Loper2020} represented by perceived understanding, competence, and thoughtfulness, as well as cognitive workload by using NASA-TLX~\cite{info:doi/10.2196/19472}, and usability by using SUS~\cite{doi:10.1080/10447318.2018.1455307}.
With these measures, our purpose was to understand perceived diagnostic utility and decision-making support provided by the AI agents, and whether clinicians thought they would use the agents in practice.
Upon completing all the tasks, we measure the preferences while using both conventional or assertiveness-based agents, and the different levels of assertiveness.

Clinicians compared both AI agents with respect to reliability, capability, and overall preference.
To measure the levels of assertiveness rated between novice and expert clinicians, we measured the reliability and capability of the different ({\it i.e.}, from more suggestive to more imposing AI recommendations) communication tones of the assertiveness-based agent.
Clinicians rated these items on a 7-point Likert scale.

\label{fig:fig099}
\end{figure*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:chap006005005}

For {\bf RQ1}, we investigated the impact of our assertiveness-based agent on clinicians' efficiency and efficacy in terms of time performance and accuracy in diagnosing patients with the support of the AI-suggested recommendations.
Similar to the literature, we used the one-way \ac{ANOVA} test~\cite{SADEGHI2022105554, 10.1145/3491102.3517791} to compare both AI agents with respect to the following outcome measures per clinician:
(i) the time (in seconds) for diagnosing each patient ({\bf H1.1.}); and
(ii) accuracy rates via false-positives and false-negatives of clinician-provided classifications ({\bf H1.2.}).
For the efficacy differences between novice and expert clinicians during decision-making ({\bf H1.3.}), we used the chi-squared test of independence~\cite{10.1145/3411764.3445464} to assess the relationship between the expertise of clinicians and the assertiveness levels of the agents.
Regarding human-AI accuracy, our dataset has post-biopsy verification, meaning that we could measure the real ground-truth of the patient.

For {\bf RQ2}, we compared clinicians' perceptions of both conventional and assertiveness-based agents.
A possible observed pattern in perceived preference ({\bf H2.1.}) and trustworthiness ({\bf H2.2.}) was examined using the \ac{ANOVA} test and statistical significance (p < 0.05) for testing our hypothesis.
Reported scores for cognitive workload and usability ({\bf H2.3.}) were compared between the two AI agents using statistical significance (p < 0.05) for computing the likelihood of confidence.
Last, we used the one-way \ac{ANOVA} test of variance to test the levels of assertiveness for the provided clinical arguments between the two groups ({\it i.e.}, novice and expert clinicians) of medical professional experience.
Specifically, we used this test to measure the perceived preferences of clinicians in terms of reliability and capability ({\bf H2.4.}).
From ``Totally Non-Assertive'' level, {\it i.e.}, more suggestive, to ``Totally Assertive'' level, {\it i.e.}, more imposing AI recommendations, we test the overall tendency between novice and expert clinicians of the communication tone.

Finally, we used the open coding comments and feedback from focus groups, workshops, and interviews.
The purpose was to extract emerging themes from open-ended discussions during these sessions~\cite{SHIBUYA2022107131, BIEG2022107249}.
We organized the responses of clinicians using affinity diagrams to cluster workflow clinical practices and main functional ideas of the agents in greater detail~\cite{DEUTSCH2019122, 10.1145/3491101.3519863}.
Moreover, we used affinity diagramming to uncover clinicians' preferences and concerns based on the data gathered in a thematic ({\it e.g.}, card sorting) coding method.
This information was then used to inform our conclusions about exploring how to personalize and customize the AI recommendations by adapting the communication tone.

Clinicians were asked to reflect on how they used to make their decisions, what information they need to be explained by the AI models, and why they need that.
These qualitative analysis methodologies enable the identification of emerging themes in the data for revealing design considerations.
As follows (Section~\ref{sec:chap006003}), recurring themes are reported below as we detail them with provided feedback and comments from these sessions with clinicians.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:chap006006}

To test our hypotheses, we used the \texttt{scipy} library from \texttt{python} to conduct a one-way \ac{ANOVA} test with the level of medical professional experience as the main factor on the dependent variables~\cite{CASALE2022107302}.
The alpha level ($\alpha$ = 0.05) was set for statistics, and the effect size was used to quantitatively measure the magnitude of the experimental comparison effect between variables~\cite{Yigit_Mendes_2018, 10.1145/3180155.3182556}.
Briefly, we focus on statistically significant results and selectively report the results to address our hypotheses by following literature recommendations~\cite{10.1145/3301275.3302289, 10.1145/3290605.3300234, 10.1145/3491102.3517791}.
Next, we investigate the time performance (Figure~\ref{fig:fig099}), accuracy (Figure~\ref{fig:fig084}) and decision (Table~\ref{tab:tab014}) rates of clinicians, while addressing their preference choices (Figure~\ref{fig:fig085}), agreement comparisons (Table~\ref{tab:tab013}), reliability and capability (Figure~\ref{fig:fig091}).

\end{figure*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{RQ1: How does an assertiveness-based intelligent agent affect medical assessments?}
\label{sec:chap006006001}

We hypothesized that using the assertiveness-based communication between clinicians and an intelligent agent, would alter clinicians' workflow and increase the time performance of clinicians ({\bf H1.1.}) during patient diagnosis.
On average, time performance of clinicians was significantly improved with the assertiveness-based agent (M = 124.02 seconds, SD = 44.60 seconds) than with conventional agent (M = 166.12 seconds, SD = 60.42 seconds), confirming our hypothesis (Figure~\ref{fig:fig099}).
This difference was significant (F = 11.32, p = 0.005 < 0.05), indicating a large effect size (r = 0.49).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input{tables/tab014}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We also hypothesized ({\bf H1.2.}) that using the assertiveness-based agent would not negatively affect accuracy of clinicians.
Our results show (Figure~\ref{fig:fig084}) that there was no significant difference (F = 1.85, p = 0.37 > 0.05) in accuracy.
Such results are providing support for our hypothesis ({\bf H1.2.}) that clinicians' accuracy at classifying a patient was not negatively affected by being exposed to assertiveness-based explanations.
This suggests that the assertiveness-based agent could be used in clinical settings without having a negative impact on the accuracy of patient diagnosis.
To support that claim, Table~\ref{tab:tab014} shows how often clinicians accept or reject the AI recommendations.

We further examined the potential impact of personalized explanations by customizing the agent communication differently between the two groups of professional medical experience, {\it i.e.}, novice and expert clinicians ({\bf H1.3.}).
We observed a significant association between the levels of assertiveness ({\it e.g.}, from non-assertive to assertive communication tone of the clinical arguments) and the medical professional experience while revising AI recommendations ($\chi^2$ = 3.84, p = 0.001 < 0.05).
In other words, the chance of a patient getting classified correctly by a novice was significantly higher (Accuracy\textsubscript{novice} = 91\%) with the assertive agent ({\it i.e.}, imposing AI recommendations) than with the non-assertive ({\it i.e.}, more suggestive AI recommendations).
On the contrary, the chance of correctly classifying the patient by an expert clinician was slightly higher (Accuracy\textsubscript{expert} = 78\%) with the non-assertive agent.
The odds of a patient getting classified correctly by a novice had 17.4\% chance higher with the assertive agent, while expert clinicians had 4.4\% chance higher with the non-assertive agent.
These findings suggest that the level of assertiveness of the agent's communication may need to be tailored to the experience level of the clinician.
Exploring the communication tone indicate that agents may need to be more assertive for novice clinicians, while suggestive tone may be more appropriate for expert clinicians.

Finally, Table~\ref{tab:tab014} shows how often clinicians accept or reject the AI recommendations, as well as how often they are switching to a different conclusion.
The highest overall correct rate was 81.59\% in the assertive trial for novice clinicians and 66.41\% in the non-assertive trial for expert clinicians.
Moreover, experts are switching to less wrong decisions with the non-assertive agent (Total = 33.59\%).
On the other hand, novice are switching to less wrong decisions with the assertive agent (Total = 18.41\%).
Overall, clinicians did better decisions with assertiveness-based assistance while exploring how to adapt the communication tone.
The results suggest that the assertiveness-based condition may have been more favorable to both novice and expert clinicians, with higher correct acceptance and correct reject rates compared to the conventional condition.
The results highlight the importance of scenario design in evaluating the performance of clinicians, as the trials had a significant impact on the performance of both novice and expert clinicians.

\subsection{RQ2: How is an assertiveness-based agent perceived by clinicians?}
\label{sec:chap006006002}

For RQ2, we explored clinicians' perception of both AI agents.
Results for our hypothesis ({\bf H2.1}) that clinicians would have a preference (Figure~\ref{fig:fig085}) for an assertiveness-based agent were statistically significant (F = 8.35, p = 0.001 < 0.05) between the groups of interns, juniors, middles, and seniors with a large effect size (r = 0.41).
Out of the 52 participants who expressed a preference, 66\% preferred the assertiveness-based agent and another 24\% preferred the conventional agent, while 10\% did not have a preference.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure*}[htpb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.000\textwidth]{fig085}
\caption[]{Preference choices of clinicians when comparing between both conventional and assertiveness-based agents within this study. Rates of clinicians are ranging from {\it Totally Conventional} to {\it Totally Assertiveness-based} on perceived {\it reliability}, {\it capability}, and {\it overall preference} of each agent.}
\label{fig:fig085}
\end{figure*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Additional to the significant differences of preference between both conventional and assertiveness-based agents, we also analyzed perceived trust of each agent (Table~\ref{tab:tab013}).
Overall, there were only slightly differences (F = 19.47, p = 0.06 > 0.05) between conventional and assertiveness-based agents.
Besides, there were no significant differences of understanding (p = 0.14 > 0.05) between both agents.
While no significant differences in understanding could be detected between both agents, the assertiveness-based variant was considered to have greater competence (p = 0.04 < 0.05).
Moreover, we observed a trend that clinicians had higher thoughtfulness in the assertiveness-based than in the conventional agent (p = 0.001 < 0.05).
These results are providing partial support for our {\bf H2.2.} hypothesis.

We also evaluated if there were no significant differences of workload and usability between both conventional and assertiveness-based agents.
Specifically, there were no significant differences between the workload scores of the two AI agents on NASA-TLX (p = 0.38 > 0.05).
Furthermore, we observed no significant differences between the usability scores on SUS (p = 0.38 > 0.05).
Hence, providing support for our {\bf H2.3.} hypothesis for workload and usability.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\input{tables/tab013}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Finally, to assess how does clinicians perceive differently the levels of assertiveness (Figure~\ref{fig:fig091}), we compared the preferences in terms of reliability and capability from non-assertive (suggestive) to assertive (authoritative) communication of the clinical arguments.
Here, we can denote that there are significant differences for reliability (F = 31.36, p = 0.0001 < 0.05) and capability (F = 18.17, p = 0.0003 < 0.05) between groups of novice and expert clinicians.
In fact, novice clinicians perceived the assertive communication as more reliable (61\%), although not mainly feeling the same for capability (48\%).
On the other hand, expert clinicians perceived the non-assertive communication as more reliable (69\%) and capable (66\%).
Therefore, we can observe that the {\bf H2.4.} hypothesis is supported by showing that novice and expert clinicians will perceive differently the provided clinical arguments depending on if the agent is imposing the AI recommendations or being more suggestive.

\subsection{Qualitative Insights}
\label{sec:chap006006003}

We adopted a participatory approach for qualitatively analyzing our study results.
Given our collected data (focus group sessions, participant opinions, and transcripts), we used emergent affinity diagrams to identify common themes in how participants intend to have their clinical arguments and visualization of the AI recommendations.
Our qualitative analysis of participant responses to open-ended survey questions yielded insights on how assertiveness-based agents can affect cliniciansâ€™ workflows and their mental model.

\subsubsection{Altering Clinical Workflows}
\label{sec:chap006006003001}

To validate the proposed design, we discussed with clinicians how could they use these set of personalized agent communications to perform diagnosis on a real clinical environment.
The goal is to understand whether an assertiveness-based agent can (a) be compatible integrated into clinicians' workflow, and (b) provide added values to clinicians' diagnosis process.
Next, we summarize the main opinions of clinicians between conventional and assertiveness-based assistance, as well as between suggestive (non-assertive) and more imposing (assertive) AI recommendations.

One major criticism to the traditional approach of representing the AI recommendations with numeric BIRADS classification, accuracy of the output and heatmap values is that it is not sufficient for clinicians to make sense of the decision-making reasoning behind the output classifications.
In particular, when the output accuracy is lower than 80\% confidence.
Our qualitative findings suggest that in choosing between numeric representations of the AI output classifications and human-interpretable arguments while exploring how to adapt the communication, clinicians found the latter to be more effective during decision-making.
This highlights the necessity for AI systems to be designed with a user-centered approach~\cite{10.1145/3491102.3517789, Zimmerman2014}, taking into account the preferences and needs of the end-users (in this case, clinicians) to ensure that they are usable and effective in real-world scenarios.

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
Specifically, a middle clinician ({\it i.e.}, expert clinician) reported:

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
``{\it When I was interacting with the AI agents, the first thing I did was to find classification conflicts between the final BIRADS of the patient, the BIRADS of each image, output accuracy, and clinical arguments. Something that I couldn't do so well in the first [conventional] agent, but could do better for the second [assertiveness-based] one.}'' (C51)

\vspace{2.5mm}

In domains where clinicians' availability is rare, it can be exceedingly hard to obtain an immediate second reader every time a clinician needs the opinion of another human expert.
Clinicians shared a positive attitude towards the use of an assertiveness-based agent to aid their decision-making, since we are exploring how these set of agents are adapting the communication depending on the level of professional medical experience.
Something that is common when a senior (assertively) talks to an intern, while our agent is mimicking the same communication conditions.
Such mimicking behavior must be designed to help diagnosis without incurring in learning misinformation that interrupts the main clinical workflow.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{figure*}[bp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.000\textwidth]{fig091}
\caption[]{Ratings between novice and expert clinicians for perceived reliability and capability. Clinicians rated each agent, ranging from {\it Totally Non-Assertive} to {\it Totally Assertive} communication.}
\label{fig:fig091}
\end{figure*}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\noindent
Here, a senior clinician ({\it i.e.}, expert clinician) is sustaining the above argument by reporting that:

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
``{\it Adapting the communication between more suggestive [non-assertive] or assertive tone of the clinical arguments can help the diagnosis workflow. I may prefer a suggestive agent, but an assertive agent will be more helpful for my interns concerning an educational purpose.}'' (C15)

\vspace{2.5mm}

Categorically, clinicians were mostly stating that they could understand how such personalized communication could be beneficial to customize the interaction between humans and AI.
In particular, clinicians valued the opportunity to choose the communication tone to explore the clinical arguments in a more detailed fashion.
Our qualitative findings suggest that most clinicians (48/52) found the assertiveness-based agent to be more helpful and reliable.
These findings also support our claim that customization could have a positive impact on the decision-making process and improve the overall effectiveness of AI-assisted systems.

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
As another example, a junior clinician ({\it i.e.}, novice clinician) reported that:

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
``{\it When the agent is talking to me in a more assertive way, I can feel more safe of my decision... and feeling more assurance of the right answer.}'' (C17)

\vspace{2.5mm}

This analysis further highlights the effectiveness of the assertiveness-based agent in personalizing and customizing the communication of the agent, taking into account differences of medical professional experience.
That is, 37 out of 52 clinicians in our study explicitly mentioned that their workflow differed between the two agents.
Particularly, clinicians showed different confidence and trusting opinions depending on the levels of assertiveness.

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
For instance, an intern clinician ({\it i.e.}, novice clinician) reported that:

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
``{\it It seems like, when I was interacting with the more suggestive [non-assertive] assistant, it has the same doubts on the communication tone as I am. The more assertive assistant gave me higher confidence in the decision.}'' (C10)

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
On the other hand, a senior clinician ({\it i.e.}, expert clinician) reported the following:

\vspace{2.5mm}

\noindent
``{\it In my opinion, I don't like the communication tone and the way assertive agents are reporting the clinical arguments. Imposing the AI recommendations feels like I need to follow the orders they give to me. I prefer a more suggestive agent, asking me if the clinical arguments are well classified or not.}'' (C49)

\vspace{2.5mm}

To conclude, these levels of personalizing and customizing the agent communication ({\it e.g.}, from less assertive to more assertive) are important to take into account when designing systems for critical domains.
Especially, for decision-making under these clinical workflows.
We found that assertiveness-based not only enhanced decision-making, but also helped clinicians to develop a mental model of the AI agents, or probe for the likelihood of the diagnosis.
Next, we describe in what manner our work is leveraging these insights.

\subsubsection{Agent Mental Models}
\label{sec:chap006006003002}

Both novice and expert clinicians have preconceived mental models about the levels of assertiveness in different ways.
As an example, expert clinicians used the output results to disambiguate AI errors from their own errors, depending on the communication tone.
It is, therefore, possible that this reasoning behavior is projected onto the AI agent to anticipate where the agent would likely make mistakes: ``{\it It could be also important to adapt the communication tone of the clinical arguments depending on the AI confidence.}''
From here, we could understand that expert clinicians expect that the assertiveness of a clinical argument can also be adapted depending on the accuracy of the AI output results for that particular variable.
On the contrary, novice clinicians were more focused on the learning process and patient comparisons for educational purpose: ``{\it For me, the most important thing was to look at the provided arguments and understand if they are right from what I learn or from similar cases. A junior like me must have an idea how the machine is thinking to mentally follow the same reasoning process from my side.}''
Hence, it is important to provide a more `{\it storytelling-like}' view of the patient for novice clinicians, even though in a more assertive fashion.

Apart from preconceptions, we further observed that clinicians developed comparative mental models between conventional and assertiveness-based agents: ``{\it The first AI [assertiveness-based] was outstandingâ€¦ but in the second AI [conventional] I was frustrated with the lack of communication in comparison to the first one.}''
Moreover, the interaction experience of clinicians with the different AI agents can also shape their reasoning while looking for AI recommendation mistakes: ``{\it In the second assistant [assertiveness-based], I look for classification conflicts between the final BIRADS and the clinical arguments, while I couldn't do the same for the first assistant [conventional], taking me more time to see if there are some mistakes.}''

Our intelligent agents can leverage these insights by not only provide a personalized and customized communication with different perspectives between novice and expert clinicians, but also correction behavior while adjusting internal representations of specific levels of assertiveness. Yet, without hurting time performance of the diagnostic (Section~\ref{sec:chap006001}), nor increasing the workload (Section~\ref{sec:chap006002}).
In sum, these observations support growing evidence that taking into account the communication of the AI outputs ({\it e.g.}, structure, order, and tone of the arguments) can alter the clinicians' perceptions of the mental models of assisting agents.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:chap006007}

In this work, we studied how personalized and customized communication of an intelligent agent can aid clinicians in their decision-making during medical imaging diagnosis.
We conducted a within-subject to investigate how clinicians perceive assertiveness-based agents differently.
Our results are showing that assertiveness-based agents can alter clinicians' workflows by increasing the efficiency of clinicians while maintaining overall efficacy.

Overall, the classification accuracy was not affected by providing assertiveness-based communication.
We observed a significant effect of differences between novice and expert clinicians, depending on the explanations tone.
This promising insight motivates future directions in the development and validation of compliant agents, capable of providing relevant and customized explanations.

Participants were keener on following AI recommendations that adapt their communication tone than the one that did not.
Although this effect may occur because of adding more explanations, it reflected in differences of behavioral decisions between novice and expert clinicians.
We gain even more insight on the effect of tone from the feedback provided by the clinicians across our qualitative analysis.
Our qualitative results are showing that participants appreciate the idea of adapting tone to probe the likelihood of the diagnosis.
This finding might be in line with the previous research in psychology and decision support science~\cite{LOMBROZO2010303, 10.1093/mind/fzu023, Seidel2021}, bringing new directions for the theoretical application of assertiveness-based communication in deep learning systems and clinical domains.

We studied how personalizing and customizing the AI recommendations according to the professional experience of each clinician can reduce medical errors and increase satisfaction.
Specifically, we found significant differences in terms of accuracy, perceived reliability and capability between novice and expert clinicians, depending on the tone of the personalized explanations.
This finding is relevant in the design of AI agents for the healthcare sector, while providing a contribution to the HCI field.

Clinicians' overall preferences and perceived trust were also increased for the assertiveness-based agent in comparison with the conventional.
Results suggest a higher perceived understanding of the assertiveness-based agent compared to the conventional variant.
On the same hand, the assertiveness-based agent showed to be perceived by clinicians as more competent and thoughtful.
However, our results are indicating the existence of other latent variables.
For instance, the demographic characteristics of clinicians with different levels of clinical experience could shape the implementation of intelligent agents to take into account the differences in clinicians' perception of AI systems generally.

In terms of results significance for the HCI community, our research focuses on the use of intelligent agents in medical imaging, which is an important and growing area within HCI.
By developing personalized and customized explanations, we aim to improve the effectiveness of decision-making by human clinicians, which is a key concern in HCI.
Our specific contribution to the CHI community is the design of a novel interactive approach for personalized and customized explanations on intelligent agents, underpinned by computational principles.
Our approach combines machine learning with image processing techniques to generate explanations that are tailored to the individual clinician's expertise.
To our knowledge, this is the first time that this approach has been proposed and evaluated in the context of medical imaging.

Concerning the broader implications of our work, we believe that it has relevance for both decision support research and AI communication research.
Our approach to personalized and customized explanations has the potential to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of decision-making by humans in critical domains, which is an essential goal in decision-support research.
At the same time, our work also contributes to the growing body of research on how to improve the communication between AI systems and human users, which is a key concern in AI communication research.
Next, we are discussing the design implications and generalizability of our findings, by concluding the limitations of our study and directions for future work.

\subsection{Design Implications}
\label{sec:chap006007001}

Our findings have different stages of design implications for the development of novel AI-assisted systems in this clinical domain.
Presented findings are ranging from the combination of different knowledge classifiers of the clinical arguments, training these models with enriched information, to the design of user interfaces for embedded intelligent agents.
In addition, it is important to conduct further research to explore the potential benefits and limitations of different knowledge representation methods and to evaluate the effectiveness of different design features in enhancing the performance of AI systems.
Ultimately, our findings aim to inform the development of more human-centered medical AI systems that effectively support clinical decision-making and enhance patient outcomes.
As follows, we will provide our recommendations to inform future work on human-centered medical AI systems.

\subsubsection{Different Knowledge Combination}
\label{sec:chap006007001001}

In a real clinical workflow, extra patient information is necessary for a proper breast cancer diagnosis.
Providing the lesion details and relevance of the classification is an important functionality for better decision-making.
From our interviews, we learn that such information is crucial for diagnostic speed and accuracy, as it informs the clinician on what to look for and where to find the lesions.
To better match the AI with the mental model of clinicians and provide better guidance, as well as explanations, we should incorporate granular patient information from the model classifiers~\cite{doi:10.1148/ryai.210299}.
For instance, the AI might use different classifiers to provide information on the lesion contours, whereas other classifiers are focused on the lesion margins.
This assumption takes us to another recommendation, how should we train the models with such mixed information, for proper integration into real clinical workflows.

\subsubsection{Training Mixed Models}
\label{sec:chap006007001002}

Our study suggests that clinical workflows and trust can be positively affected by endowing personalization of the agent communication.
In fact, with the ability to, not only incorporate granular patient information from the mixed model classifiers, but also adapt the tone depending on the medical experience of the clinician.
Implementation of such intelligent agents would require that DL models are equipped with the additional prediction of mixed clinical arguments ({\it e.g.}, lesion contours, margin, or cancer type of the patient) beyond diagnosis alone.
This additional granular information about the patient could include its importance to the diagnostic, while also customizing the communication tone depending on the various demographic characteristics of clinicians.
Such an idea could be integrated either into one fused training, or by developing multi separated models, one for each clinical variable.
% Such an idea could be integrated either into one fused training~\cite{cortez2021fullyautomated}, or by developing multi separated models, one for each clinical variable~\cite{ALANTARI201844}.

\subsubsection{Adapting Communication}
\label{sec:chap006007001003}

In this work, we evaluate one specific way of personalizing and customizing the communication between agents and clinicians with different levels of medical experience.
We did that by exploring how to adapt the communication tone depending on if the agent was communicating with a novice or an expert clinician.
While our results suggest that this communication technique may be effective, we recommend that future work may explore different demographic characteristics of clinicians.
For example, from different medical institutions ({\it e.g.}, public hospitals, private clinics, cancer centers, etc), or different medical fields ({\it e.g.}, family physicians, breast surgeons, etc.), where some behavioral decision-making of clinicians should differ.
Besides, our qualitative results (Section~\ref{sec:chap006006002}) are showing that clinicians are also willing for adapting the communication tone of the clinical arguments depending on the AI confidence.
For instance, if confidence is greater than 80\%, then the system should display an Assertive recommendation (Figure~\ref{fig:fig098}, middle).
Otherwise, it should display a Non-Assertive recommendation (Figure~\ref{fig:fig098}, bottom).
As a research direction, we should explore how different performance actions of the intelligent agents will impact behavioral decision-making of clinicians.

\subsubsection{Generalizability}
\label{sec:chap006007001004}

Through this exploration, our study sheds light on the use of assertiveness-based agents in the specific domain of breast cancer based on medical imaging diagnosis.
It is important to note that the results of our study should not be generalized to other medical domains without caution.
Hence, we warn in generalizing the results of this study to other domains.
However, we argue that similar communication techniques of personalized and customized explanations can be useful for various types of medical diagnosis because the challenges motivating our study are common across several other medical specialties.

Despite our focus on the breast cancer domain, this demographic characteristics of clinicians ({\it i.e.}, differences in behavioral decision-making between novice and expert) is transversal to other applications~\cite{STAHNKE2021103243, LANDRO2020102897, doi:10.1080/21642850.2020.1741372}.
Such claim is making our approach useful beyond the specific domain of breast cancer diagnosis.
For instance, lung cancer diagnosis requires that specialized radiologists visually inspect chest imaging data similar in nature to that used in our study~\cite{10.1145/3313831.3376807}.
In both of these fields, it may be valuable to personalize and customize the agent communication, depending on their background and expertise, leading to more accurate diagnoses and improved patient outcomes.

The potential of personalizing and customizing the agent communication depending on the levels of medical experience can also be addressed for other clinical domains.
As another example, in skin cancer some works are trying to mimic the medical procedures, where clinicians rely on their past experience across similar cases to reach the final diagnosis~\cite{10.1007/978-3-030-87199-4_52, Tschandl2020, Esteva2017}.
Depending on the past experience of that clinician, the agent should adapt the provided information and communication to them, or other customizable techniques.
Others are stating that AI-based systems must be improved with personalized medicine supporting diagnosis and treatment guidance~\cite{Sollini2020, Aerts2016, IBRAHIM2019438}.
These studies suggest that the recommendations we make for medical imaging diagnosis in this work have been considered independently and may be of merit beyond the development of assertiveness-based agents.

% Hence, it is important to provide a more `{\it storytelling-like}' view of the patient for novice clinicians, even though in a more assertive fashion.

\subsection{Limitations}
\label{sec:chap006007002}

In this work, we conducted a within-subject experiment to investigate the use of assertiveness-based agents by clinicians in the particular medical domain of breast cancer diagnosis.
We investigate this question through the design and study of Assertiveness-based BreastScreening-AI.
More specifically, this tool was used to explore how an intelligent agent should adapt its communication tone depending on the professional experience ({\it i.e.}, novice vs expert) of the clinician.

Due to the short availability of clinicians and the remote nature of our study, it was challenging to control the tasks of each step in the experiment precisely.
For example, participants varied how long they complete the task for the first patient, in comparison to the second and third patients.
This lack in experimental control may have impacted the degree to which exposure to the first patient, while interacting for the first time with the assertiveness-based agent, affected how clinicians interacted with the latter.

Another limitation is related with the implications of liability when using AI in medical settings~\cite{10.1145/3555157}, where the legal framework for addressing these issues is still evolving.
The use of AI in medical settings raises complex questions that are not yet fully understood or addressed by existing laws and regulations~\cite{10.1145/3411764.3445432}.
This can make it difficult to determine who might be liable in the event of an error or harm caused by an AI system.
AI systems often operate in complex and dynamic environments, making it challenging to identify the specific factors that led to a particular outcome.
Overall, the limitations concerning the implications of liability when using AI in medical settings highlight the need for further research and legal developments in this area.
It is important for policymakers and other stakeholders to continue to explore these issues and work to address them in a way that ensures the safe and effective use of AI in medical settings.

In our study, the assertiveness-based agent was using specific AI outputs, curated and selected by us alongside choosing the most typical clinical setups in a real-world environment.
While prior work has demonstrated the potential of predicting the likelihood of a clinician to trust on an AI recommendation from raw medical data~\cite{pmlr-v97-raghu19a}, future work should focus on training DL models based on personalized and customized explanations to provide human-interpretable arguments for clinicians.

As another future direction, we will study the effects of the two different main features of the assertiveness-based agent ({\it i.e.}, explanations and tone), in more conditions separately (Section~\ref{sec:app001007}).
However, inferring useful information for adapting the DL model, presents new technical challenges for the AI community.
For the HCI community, the challenge is making such inferences transparent, considering some behavioral characteristics of clinicians.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:chap006008}

In this work, we provide a novel perspective on how to personalize and customize the explanations of intelligent agents to human clinicians.
Our results from an experimental study with 52 clinicians comparing a conventional agent to an assertiveness-based agent suggest that the ability of a system to not only exploring how to adapt the communication tone ({\it i.e.}, more suggestive or more assertive), but also provide granular explanations of patient cases has merits for end users.
From our results, the time performance was satisfactory, where clinicians took less 25\% of the time to diagnose a patient with the assertiveness-based agent in comparison to the conventional agent.
As we observed, the caparison between the conventional agent and the assertiveness-based agent was more effective also with the latter in achieving the proper diagnostic of the patient.
Additionally, our results demonstrate that if explanations are adapted taking into account the medical experience of clinicians, accuracy chance of correctly diagnosing a patient is 91\% higher for novice and 78\% higher for expert clinicians.
Last, clinicians are showing an increase of trust, preferring the assertiveness-based agent by being more reliable and capable, as this agent was revealing to be further understandable, competent and thoughtful.
Our work has implications for the design of AI systems not only in the medical domains, but also in fields that are facing similar challenges, demanding a personalization of the human-AI interaction.
