\caption{The ANOVA factorial analysis table regarding NASA-TLX for {\it Mental Demand (MD)}, {\it Physical Demand (PD)} and {\it Temporal Demand (TD)}, where {\it F} is the variation between sample means and the variation within samples. To determine whether any of the differences between the means are statistically significant, the {\it Sig.} was used for significance. On the present study, a 20-point Likert Scale was used regarding Workload. The factorial analysis was described assuming $\alpha = 0.05$. Also, each time $p < 0.05$ it is marked with the $\star$ symbol.}
