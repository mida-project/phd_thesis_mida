abstract={The rapid increase in telemedicine coupled with recent advances in diagnostic artificial intelligence (AI) create the imperative to consider the opportunities and risks of inserting AI-based support into new paradigms of care. Here we build on recent achievements in the accuracy of image-based AI for skin cancer diagnosis to address the effects of varied representations of AI-based support across different levels of clinical expertise and multiple clinical workflows. We find that good quality AI-based support of clinical decision-making improves diagnostic accuracy over that of either AI or physicians alone, and that the least experienced clinicians gain the most from AI-based support. We further find that AI-based multiclass probabilities outperformed content-based image retrieval (CBIR) representations of AI in the mobile technology environment, and AI-based support had utility in simulations of second opinions and of telemedicine triage. In addition to demonstrating the potential benefits associated with good quality AI in the hands of non-expert clinicians, we find that faulty AI can mislead the entire spectrum of clinicians, including experts. Lastly, we show that insights derived from AI class-activation maps can inform improvements in human diagnosis. Together, our approach and findings offer a framework for future studies across the spectrum of image-based diagnostics to improve human--computer collaboration in clinical practice.},

abstract = {Medical data labeling workflows critically depend on accurate assessments from human experts. Yet human assessments can vary markedly, even among medical experts. Prior research has demonstrated benefits of labeler training on performance. Here we utilized two types of labeler training feedback: highlighting incorrect labels for difficult cases ("individual performance" feedback), and expert discussions from adjudication of these cases. We presented ten generalist eye care professionals with either individual performance alone, or individual performance and expert discussions from specialists. Compared to performance feedback alone, seeing expert discussions significantly improved generalists' understanding of the rationale behind the correct diagnosis while motivating changes in their own labeling approach; and also significantly improved average accuracy on one of four pathologies in a held-out test set. This work suggests that image adjudication may provide benefits beyond developing trusted consensus labels, and that exposure to specialist discussions can be an effective training intervention for medical diagnosis.},

abstract={Screening mammography aims to identify breast cancer at earlier stages of the disease, when treatment can be more successful1. Despite the existence of screening programmes worldwide, the interpretation of mammograms is affected by high rates of false positives and false negatives2. Here we present an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is capable of surpassing human experts in breast cancer prediction. To assess its performance in the clinical setting, we curated a large representative dataset from the UK and a large enriched dataset from the USA. We show an absolute reduction of 5.7{\%} and 1.2{\%} (USA and UK) in false positives and 9.4{\%} and 2.7{\%} in false negatives. We provide evidence of the ability of the system to generalize from the UK to the USA. In an independent study of six radiologists, the AI system outperformed all of the human readers: the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) for the AI system was greater than the AUC-ROC for the average radiologist by an absolute margin of 11.5{\%}. We ran a simulation in which the AI system participated in the double-reading process that is used in the UK, and found that the AI system maintained non-inferior performance and reduced the workload of the second reader by 88{\%}. This robust assessment of the AI system paves the way for clinical trials to improve the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer screening.},

abstract={In the last two decades, Computer Aided Detection (CAD) systems were developed to help radiologists analyse screening mammograms, however benefits of current CAD technologies appear to be contradictory, therefore they should be improved to be ultimately considered useful. Since 2012, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been a tremendous success in image recognition, reaching human performance. These methods have greatly surpassed the traditional approaches, which are similar to currently used CAD solutions. Deep CNN-s have the potential to revolutionize medical image analysis. We propose a CAD system based on one of the most successful object detection frameworks, Faster R-CNN. The system detects and classifies malignant or benign lesions on a mammogram without any human intervention. The proposed method sets the state of the art classification performance on the public INbreast database, AUC = 0.95. The approach described here has achieved 2nd place in the Digital Mammography DREAM Challenge with AUC = 0.85. When used as a detector, the system reaches high sensitivity with very few false positive marks per image on the INbreast dataset.

abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) frame opportunities and challenges for user interface design. Principles for human-AI interaction have been discussed in the human-computer interaction community for over two decades, but more study and innovation are needed in light of advances in AI and the growing uses of AI technologies in human-facing applications. We propose 18 generally applicable design guidelines for human-AI interaction. These guidelines are validated through multiple rounds of evaluation including a user study with 49 design practitioners who tested the guidelines against 20 popular AI-infused products. The results verify the relevance of the guidelines over a spectrum of interaction scenarios and reveal gaps in our knowledge, highlighting opportunities for further research. Based on the evaluations, we believe the set of design guidelines can serve as a resource to practitioners working on the design of applications and features that harness AI technologies, and to researchers interested in the further development of human-AI interaction design principles.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays an increasingly important role in improving HCI and user experience. Yet many challenges persist in designing and innovating valuable human-AI interactions. For example, AI systems can make unpredictable errors, and these errors damage UX and even lead to undesired societal impact. However, HCI routinely grapples with complex technologies and mitigates their unintended consequences. What makes AI different? What makes human-AI interaction appear particularly difficult to design? This paper investigates these questions. We synthesize prior research, our own design and research experience, and our observations when teaching human-AI interaction. We identify two sources of AI's distinctive design challenges: 1) uncertainty surrounding AI's capabilities, 2) AI's output complexity, spanning from simple to adaptive complex. We identify four levels of AI systems. On each level, designers encounter a different subset of the design challenges. We demonstrate how these findings reveal new insights for designers, researchers, and design tool makers in productively addressing the challenges of human-AI interaction going forward.},

Using medical imaging as a point of departure, we conducted three iterations of design activities to formulate CheXplain — a system that enables physicians to explore and understand AI-enabled chest X-ray analysis: (i) a paired survey between referring physicians and radiologists reveals whether, when, and what kinds of explanations are needed; (ii) a low-fidelity prototype co-designed with three physicians formulates eight key features; and (iii) a high-fidelity prototype evaluated by another six physicians provides detailed summative insights on how each feature enables the exploration and understanding of AI. We summarize by discussing recommendations for future work to design and implement explainable medical AI systems that encompass four recurring themes: motivation, constraint, explanation, and justification.},

  abstract = {Purpose To evaluate the benefits of an artificial intelligence (AI)–based tool for two-dimensional mammography in the breast cancer detection process. Materials and Methods In this multireader, multicase retrospective study, 14 radiologists assessed a dataset of 240 digital mammography images, acquired between 2013 and 2106, using a counterbalance design in which half of the dataset was read without AI and the other half with the help of AI during a first session and vice versa during a second session, which was separated from the first by a washout period. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints. Results The average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95\% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95\% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95\% CI: 0.002, 0.055, P = .035). Average sensitivity was increased by 0.033 when using AI support (P = .021). Reading time changed dependently to the AI-tool score. For low likelihood of malignancy (< 2.5\%), the time was about the same in the first reading session and slightly decreased in the second reading session. For higher likelihood of malignancy, the reading time was on average increased with the use of AI. Conclusion This clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI-ML) have taken center stage in medical imaging. To develop as leaders in AI-ML, radiology residents may seek a formative data science experience. We piloted an elective Data Science Pathway (DSP) for fourth year residents at our institution in collaboration with the XX for Clinical Data Science (CCDS). The goal of the DSP was to provide an introduction to AI-ML through a flexible schedule of educational, experiential and research activities. We describe our initial experience with the DSP tailored to the AI-ML interests of three senior radiology residents. We discuss logistics and curricular design with common core elements and shared mentorship. Residents were provided dedicated, full-time immersion into the CCDS work environment. In the initial DSP pilot, residents were successfully integrated into AI-ML projects at CCDS. Residents were exposed to all aspects of AI-ML application development, including data curation, model design, quality control, and clinical testing. Core concepts in AI-ML were taught through didactic sessions and daily collaboration with data scientists and other staff. Work during the pilot period led to twelve accepted abstracts for presentation at national meetings. The DSP is a feasible, well-rounded introductory experience in AI-ML for senior radiology residents. Residents contributed to model and tool development at multiple stages and were academically productive. Feedback from the pilot resulted in establishment of a formal AI-ML curriculum for future residents. The logistical, planning, and curricular considerations we describe provide a framework for DSP implementation at other institutions.},

  abstract = {Although computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is widely used in mammography, conventional CAD programs that use prompts to indicate potential cancers on the mammograms have not led to an improvement in diagnostic accuracy. Because of the advances in machine learning, especially with use of deep (multilayered) convolutional neural networks, artificial intelligence has undergone a transformation that has improved the quality of the predictions of the models. Recently, such deep learning algorithms have been applied to mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). In this review, the authors explain how deep learning works in the context of mammography and DBT and define the important technical challenges. Subsequently, they discuss the current status and future perspectives of artificial intelligence–based clinical applications for mammography, DBT, and radiomics. Available algorithms are advanced and approach the performance of radiologists—especially for cancer detection and risk prediction at mammography. However, clinical validation is largely lacking, and it is not clear how the power of deep learning should be used to optimize practice. Further development of deep learning models is necessary for DBT, and this requires collection of larger databases. It is expected that deep learning will eventually have an important role in DBT, including the generation of synthetic images.© RSNA, 2019Online supplemental material is available for this article.},

There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

abstract = {Background It is of paramount importance to evaluate the impact of participation in organized mammography service screening independently from changes in breast cancer treatment. This can be done by measuring the incidence of fatal breast cancer, which is based on the date of diagnosis and not on the date of death. Methods Among 549,091 women, covering approximately 30\% of the Swedish screening-eligible population, the authors calculated the incidence rates of 2473 breast cancers that were fatal within 10 years after diagnosis and the incidence rates of 9737 advanced breast cancers. Data regarding each breast cancer diagnosis and the cause and date of death of each breast cancer case were gathered from national Swedish registries. Tumor characteristics were collected from regional cancer centers. Aggregated data concerning invitation and participation were provided by Sectra Medical Systems AB. Incidence rates were analyzed using Poisson regression. Results Women who participated in mammography screening had a statistically significant 41\% reduction in their risk of dying of breast cancer within 10 years (relative risk, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.51-0.68 [P < .001]) and a 25\% reduction in the rate of advanced breast cancers (relative risk, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.66-0.84 [P < .001]). Conclusions Substantial reductions in the incidence rate of breast cancers that were fatal within 10 years after diagnosis and in the advanced breast cancer rate were found in this contemporaneous comparison of women participating versus those not participating in screening. These benefits appeared to be independent of recent changes in treatment regimens.},

Seven studies (80.8\\% of screens) reported interval cancers: the pooled difference showed no change in the interval cancer rate with −0.02 per 1000 screens (95\\% CI = −0.06 to 0.03). Restricting analysis to studies at low risk of bias resulted in findings consistent with the overall pooled results for all outcomes.The increase in cancer detection following the practice shift to digital mammography did not translate into a reduction in the interval cancer rate. Recall rates were increased. These results suggest the transition from film to digital mammography did not result in health benefits for screened women. This analysis reinforces the need to carefully evaluate effects of future changes in technology, such as tomosynthesis, to ensure new technology leads to improved health outcomes and beyond technical gains.}",

abstract={Although screening mammography has delivered many benefits since its introduction in Canada in 1988, questions about perceived harms warrant an up-to-date review. To help oncologists and physicians provide optimal patient recommendations, the literature was reviewed to find the latest guidelines for screening mammography, including benefits and perceived harms of overdiagnosis, false positives, false negatives, and technologic advances. For women 40-74 years of age who actually participate in screening every 1-2 years, breast cancer mortality is reduced by 40{\%}. With appropriate corrections, overdiagnosis accounts for 10{\%} or fewer breast cancers. False positives occur in about 10{\%} of screened women, 80{\%} of which are resolved with additional imaging, and 10{\%}, with breast biopsy. An important limitation of screening is the false negatives (15{\%}-20{\%}). The technologic advances of digital breast tomosynthesis, breast ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging counter the false negatives of screening mammography, particularly in women with dense breast tissue.},

abstract={IMPORTANCE: Breast cancer is a leading cause of premature mortality among US women. Early detection has been shown to be associated with reduced breast cancer morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To update the American Cancer Society (ACS) 2003 breast cancer screening guideline for women at average risk for breast cancer. PROCESS: The ACS commissioned a systematic evidence review of the breast cancer screening literature to inform the update and a supplemental analysis of mammography registry data to address questions related to the screening interval. Formulation of recommendations was based on the quality of the evidence and judgment (incorporating values and preferences) about the balance of benefits and harms. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Screening mammography in women aged 40 to 69 years is associated with a reduction in breast cancer deaths across a range of study designs, and inferential evidence supports breast cancer screening for women 70 years and older who are in good health. Estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of false-positive examination results are greater if screening begins at younger ages because of the greater number of mammograms, as well as the higher recall rate in younger women. The quality of the evidence for overdiagnosis is not sufficient to estimate a lifetime risk with confidence. Analysis examining the screening interval demonstrates more favorable tumor characteristics when premenopausal women are screened annually vs biennially. Evidence does not support routine clinical breast examination as a screening method for women at average risk. RECOMMENDATIONS: The ACS recommends that women with an average risk of breast cancer should undergo regular screening mammography starting at age 45 years (strong recommendation). Women aged 45 to 54 years should be screened annually (qualified recommendation). Women 55 years and older should transition to biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually (qualified recommendation). Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between the ages of 40 and 44 years (qualified recommendation). Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer (qualified recommendation). The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any age (qualified recommendation). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These updated ACS guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for breast cancer screening for women at average risk of breast cancer. These recommendations should be considered by physicians and women in discussions about breast cancer screening.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mortality and population data were sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) database, and age-standardized mortality rates were calculated using the standard world population. Changes in mortality trends were analyzed using Joinpoint Trend Analysis Software. RESULTS: The majority of analyzed countries showed a meaningful decrease in BC mortality among women aged 45+. However, the results of our study suggest that there are 4 EU countries - Croatia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia - where increasing BC mortality trends started to be visible in the analyzed age group. Currently, the observed increase is still not significant, but the obtained data suggest the possibility of further continuation of the observed trend in the future. Moreover, in Bulgaria we also noted continuation of the increase in BC mortality (statistically significant). CONCLUSIONS: Due to the availability of better treatment options, as well as presence of effective tools for detecting BC at the early stages of progression, BC mortality is falling in most analyzed European countries. To maintain this situation and to stop BC mortality increase in the analyzed age group in Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, immediate actions for improvement of BC management in the European health care systems should be considered.},

The higher incidence is partly attributed to the higher prevalence of lifestyle risk factors, while the higher survival is attributed to better access to beneficial treatments and general health care. Most of the countries in Southern Europe or the former Eastern Bloc have not yet reached the high GDP per capita status (2017 purchasing power parity; PPP) of the earlier established Western democracies. The breast cancer incidence and survival are associated with the PPP level (both higher for the higher PPP category; 2017 PPP above USD 40,000).

Background
Mammography is the current standard for breast cancer screening. This study aimed to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm for diagnosis of breast cancer in mammography, and explore whether it could benefit radiologists by improving accuracy of diagnosis.
Methods
In this retrospective study, an AI algorithm was developed and validated with 170 230 mammography examinations collected from five institutions in South Korea, the USA, and the UK, including 36 468 cancer positive confirmed by biopsy, 59 544 benign confirmed by biopsy (8827 mammograms) or follow-up imaging (50 717 mammograms), and 74 218 normal. For the multicentre, observer-blinded, reader study, 320 mammograms (160 cancer positive, 64 benign, 96 normal) were independently obtained from two institutions. 14 radiologists participated as readers and assessed each mammogram in terms of likelihood of malignancy (LOM), location of malignancy, and necessity to recall the patient, first without and then with assistance of the AI algorithm. The performance of AI and radiologists was evaluated in terms of LOM-based area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and recall-based sensitivity and specificity.
Findings
The AI standalone performance was AUROC 0·959 (95% CI 0·952–0·966) overall, and 0·970 (0·963–0·978) in the South Korea dataset, 0·953 (0·938–0·968) in the USA dataset, and 0·938 (0·918–0·958) in the UK dataset. In the reader study, the performance level of AI was 0·940 (0·915–0·965), significantly higher than that of the radiologists without AI assistance (0·810, 95% CI 0·770–0·850; p<0·0001). With the assistance of AI, radiologists' performance was improved to 0·881 (0·850–0·911; p<0·0001). AI was more sensitive to detect cancers with mass (53 [90%] vs 46 [78%] of 59 cancers detected; p=0·044) or distortion or asymmetry (18 [90%] vs ten [50%] of 20 cancers detected; p=0·023) than radiologists. AI was better in detection of T1 cancers (73 [91%] vs 59 [74%] of 80; p=0·0039) or node-negative cancers (104 [87%] vs 88 [74%] of 119; p=0·0025) than radiologists.
Interpretation
The AI algorithm developed with large-scale mammography data showed better diagnostic performance in breast cancer detection compared with radiologists. The significant improvement in radiologists' performance when aided by AI supports application of AI to mammograms as a diagnostic support tool.

Despite sparse evidence that CAD improves accuracy of mammographic interpretations and costs over \\$400 million a year, CAD is currently used for most screening mammograms in the United States.To measure performance of digital screening mammography with and without CAD in US community practice.We compared the accuracy of digital screening mammography interpreted with (n = 495 818) vs without (n = 129 807) CAD from 2003 through 2009 in 323 973 women. Mammograms were interpreted by 271 radiologists from 66 facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. Linkage with tumor registries identified 3159 breast cancers in 323 973 women within 1 year of the screening.Mammography performance (sensitivity, specificity, and screen-detected and interval cancers per 1000 women) was modeled using logistic regression with radiologist-specific random effects to account for correlation among examinations interpreted by the same radiologist, adjusting for patient age, race/ethnicity, time since prior mammogram, examination year, and registry. Conditional logistic regression was used to compare performance among 107 radiologists who interpreted mammograms both with and without CAD.Screening performance was not improved with CAD on any metric assessed. Mammography sensitivity was 85.3\\% (95\\% CI, 83.6\\%-86.9\\%) with and 87.3\\% (95\\% CI, 84.5\\%-89.7\\%) without CAD.

There was no difference in cancer detection rate (4.1 in 1000 women screened with and without CAD). Computer-aided detection did not improve intraradiologist performance. Sensitivity was significantly decreased for mammograms interpreted with vs without CAD in the subset of radiologists who interpreted both with and without CAD (odds ratio, 0.53; 95\\% CI, 0.29-0.97).Computer-aided detection does not improve diagnostic accuracy of mammography. These results suggest that insurers pay more for CAD with no established benefit to women.}",

False-positive mammograms increased women’s intention to undergo future breast cancer screening and did not increase their stated willingness to travel to avoid a false-positive result.

abstract={An interval breast cancer is a cancer that emerges following a negative mammographic screen. This overview describes the epidemiology, and the radiological and biological characteristics of interval breast cancers in population mammography screening. Notwithstanding possible differences in ascertainment of interval breast cancers, there was broad variability in reported interval breast cancer rates (range 7.0 to 49.3 per 10,000 screens) reflecting heterogeneity in underlying breast cancer rates, screening rounds (initial or repeat screens), and the length and phase of the inter-screening interval. The majority of studies (based on biennial screening) reported interval breast cancer rates in the range of 8.4 to 21.1 per 10,000 screens spanning the two-year interval with the larger proportion occurring in the second year. Despite methodological limitations inherent in radiological surveillance (retrospective mammographic review) of interval breast cancers, this form of surveillance consistently reveals that the majority of interval cancers represent either true interval or occult cancers that were not visible on the index mammographic screen; approximately 20--25{\%} of interval breast cancers are classified as having been missed (false-negatives). The biological characteristics of interval breast cancers show that they have relatively worse tumour prognostic characteristics and biomarker profile, and also survival outcomes, than screen-detected breast cancers; however, they have similar characteristics and prognosis as breast cancers occurring in non-screened women. There was limited evidence on the effect on interval breast cancer frequency and outcomes following transition from film to digital mammography screening.},

  abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been extensively used in a range of medical fields to promote therapeutic development. The development of diverse AI techniques has also contributed to early detections, disease diagnoses, and referral management. However, concerns about the value of advanced AI in disease diagnosis have been raised by health care professionals, medical service providers, and health policy decision makers. Objective: This review aimed to systematically examine the literature, in particular, focusing on the performance comparison between advanced AI and human clinicians to provide an up-to-date summary regarding the extent of the application of AI to disease diagnoses. By doing so, this review discussed the relationship between the current advanced AI development and clinicians with respect to disease diagnosis and thus therapeutic development in the long run. Methods: We systematically searched articles published between January 2000 and March 2019 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis in the following databases: Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. According to the preset inclusion and exclusion criteria, only articles comparing the medical performance between advanced AI and human experts were considered. Results: A total of 9 articles were identified. A convolutional neural network was the commonly applied advanced AI technology. Owing to the variation in medical fields, there is a distinction between individual studies in terms of classification, labeling, training process, dataset size, and algorithm validation of AI. Performance indices reported in articles included diagnostic accuracy, weighted errors, false-positive rate, sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The results showed that the performance of AI was at par with that of clinicians and exceeded that of clinicians with less experience. Conclusions: Current AI development has a diagnostic performance that is comparable with medical experts, especially in image recognition-related fields. Further studies can be extended to other types of medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and other medical practices unrelated to images. With the continued development of AI-assisted technologies, the clinical implications underpinned by clinicians' experience and guided by patient-centered health care principle should be constantly considered in future AI-related and other technology-based medical research.},

Of radiographers within Australian BreastScreen programmes 53\% are over 50 years old, 69\% were trained in Australia and have been undertaking mammography for 10 years or more. Radiographers under 35 years old make up 12\% of the current workforce. Of the BreastScreen workforce, 63\% are employed part time. Conclusion: An estimated 78\% response rate implies that the data obtained from Australian radiographers currently working in BreastScreen is representative. Within the next five to ten years it is estimated that 30\% of BreastScreen radiographers may retire. Strategies are needed to increase workforce numbers, in order to cope with increased participation rates due to population growth and an increased target age range.},

abstract="There is large consent that successful training of deep networks requires many thousand annotated training samples. In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU. The full implementation (based on Caffe) and the trained networks are available at http://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net.",

abstract="Segmentation is a routine and crucial procedure for the treatment of brain tumors. Deep learning based brain tumor segmentation methods have achieved promising performance in recent years. However, to pursue high segmentation accuracy, most of them require too much memory and computation resources. Motivated by a recently proposed partially reversible U-Net architecture that pays more attention to memory footprint, we further present a novel Memory-Efficient Cascade 3D U-Net (MECU-Net) for brain tumor segmentation in this work, which can achieve comparable segmentation accuracy with less memory and computation consumption. More specifically, MECU-Net utilizes fewer down-sampling channels to reduce the utilization of memory and computation resources. To make up the accuracy loss, MECU-Net employs multi-scale feature fusion module to enhance the feature representation capability. Additionally, a light-weight cascade model, which resolves the problem of small target segmentation accuracy caused by model compression to some extent, is further introduced into the segmentation network. Finally, edge loss and weighted dice loss are combined to refine the brain tumor segmentation results. Experiment results on BraTS 2019 validation set illuminate that MECU-Net can achieve average Dice coefficients of 0.902, 0.824 and 0.777 on the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.",

An efficient non-invasive computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is seen as a solution to make identification process faster, and accessible to a large population. Such automated system relies on three things: reliable lesion segmentation, pertinent features’ extraction and good lesion classifier. In this paper, we propose an automated system that uses an Ant colony based segmentation algorithm, takes into consideration three types of features to describe malignant lesion:geometrical properties, textureand relative colors from which pertinent ones are selected, and uses two classifiers K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The objective of this paper is to test the efficiency of the proposed segmentation algorithm, extract most pertinent features that describe melanomas and compare the two classifiers. Our automated system is tested on 172 dermoscopic images where 88 are malignant melanomas and 84 benign lesions. The results of the proposed segmentation algorithm are encouraging as they gave promising results. 12 features seem to be sufficient to detect malignant melanoma. Moreover, ANN gives better results than KNN."

  abstract = {In the past decade, the field of medical image analysis has grown exponentially, with an increased number of pattern recognition tools and an increase in data set sizes. These advances have facilitated the development of processes for high-throughput extraction of quantitative features that result in the conversion of images into mineable data and the subsequent analysis of these data for decision support; this practice is termed radiomics. This is in contrast to the traditional practice of treating medical images as pictures intended solely for visual interpretation. Radiomic data contain first-, second-, and higher-order statistics. These data are combined with other patient data and are mined with sophisticated bioinformatics tools to develop models that may potentially improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy. Because radiomics analyses are intended to be conducted with standard of care images, it is conceivable that conversion of digital images to mineable data will eventually become routine practice. This report describes the process of radiomics, its challenges, and its potential power to facilitate better clinical decision making, particularly in the care of patients with cancer.},

abstract = "Background
The wide adoption of electronic health record systems (EHRs) in hospitals in China has made large amounts of data available for clinical research including breast cancer. Unfortunately, much of detailed clinical information is embedded in clinical narratives e.g., breast radiology reports. The American College of Radiology (ACR) has developed a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) to standardize the clinical findings from breast radiology reports.
Objectives
This study aims to develop natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract BI-RADS findings from breast ultrasound reports in Chinese, thus to support clinical operation and breast cancer research in China.
Methods
We developed and compared three different types of NLP approaches, including a rule-based method, a traditional machine learning-based method using the Conditional Random Fields (CRF) algorithm, and deep learning-based approaches, to extract all BI-RADS finding categories from breast ultrasound reports in Chinese.
Results
Using a manually annotated dataset containing 540 reports, our evaluation shows that the deep learning-based method achieved the best F1-score of 0.904, when compared with rule-based and CRF-based approaches (0.848 and 0.881 respectively).
Conclusions
This is the first study that applies deep learning technologies to BI-RADS findings extraction in Chinese breast ultrasound reports, demonstrating its potential on enabling international collaborations on breast cancer research."

abstract = "Purpose
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of overnight shifts (ONS) on radiologist fatigue, visual search pattern, and diagnostic performance.
Methods
This experimental study was approved by the institutional review board. Twelve radiologists (five faculty members and seven residents) each completed two sessions: one during a normal workday (“not fatigued”) and another in the morning after an ONS (“fatigued”). Each radiologist completed the Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory. During each session, radiologists viewed 20 bone radiographs consisting of normal and abnormal findings. Viewing time, diagnostic confidence, and eye-tracking data were recorded.
Results
Swedish Occupational Fatigue Inventory results demonstrated worsening in all five variables (lack of energy, physical exertion, physical discomfort, lack of motivation, and sleepiness) after ONS (P < .01). Overall, participants demonstrated worse diagnostic performance in the fatigued versus not fatigued state (P < .05). Total viewing time per case was longer when fatigued (35.9 ± 25.8 seconds) than not fatigued (24.8 ± 16.3 seconds) (P < .0001). Total viewing time per case was longer for residents (P < .05). Mean total fixations generated during the search increased by 60% during fatigued sessions (P < .0001). Mean time to first fixate on the fracture increased by 34% during fatigued sessions (P < .0001) and was longer for residents (P < .01). Dwell times associated with true- and false-positive decisions increased, whereas those with false negatives decreased.
Conclusions
After ONS, radiologists were more fatigued with worse diagnostic performance, a 45% increase in view time per case, a 60% increase in total gaze fixations, and a 34% increase in time to fixate on the fracture. The effects of fatigue were more pronounced in residents."

AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements.ResultsOn average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86\% [86 of 100] vs 83\% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79\% [111 of 140]) vs 77\% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87).ConclusionRadiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.See also the editorial by Bahl in this issue.},

abstract = {Optimal treatment outcomes for breast cancer are dependent on a timely diagnosis followed by an organized, multidisciplinary approach to care. However, in many low- and middle-income countries, effective care management pathways can be difficult to follow because of financial constraints, a lack of resources, an insufficiently trained workforce, and/or poor infrastructure. On the basis of prior work by the Breast Health Global Initiative, this article proposes a phased implementation strategy for developing sustainable approaches to enhancing patient care in limited-resource settings by creating roadmaps that are individualized and adapted to the baseline environment. This strategy proposes that, after a situational analysis, implementation phases begin with bolstering palliative care capacity, especially in settings where a late-stage diagnosis is common. This is followed by strengthening the patient pathway, with consideration given to a dynamic balance between centralization of services into centers of excellence to achieve better quality and decentralization of services to increase patient access. The use of resource checklists ensures that comprehensive therapy or palliative care can be delivered safely and effectively. Episodic or continuous monitoring with established process and quality metrics facilitates ongoing assessment, which should drive continual process improvements. A series of case studies provides a snapshot of country experiences with enhancing patient care, including the implementation of national cancer control plans in Kenya, palliative care in Romania, the introduction of a 1-stop clinic for diagnosis in Brazil, the surgical management of breast cancer in India, and the establishment of a women's cancer center in Ghana.},

Over the past 30 years, only the simplest imaging biomarkers (RECIST, SUV,…) have become widespread clinical tools. This may be due to our inability to accurately characterize tumors and monitor intratumoral changes in imaging. Artificial intelligence, through machine learning and deep learning, opens a new path in medical research because it can bring together a large amount of heterogeneous data into the same analysis to reach a single outcome. Supervised or unsupervised learning may lead to new paradigms by identifying unrevealed structural patterns across data. Deep learning will provide human-free, undefined upstream, reproducible, and automated quantitative imaging biomarkers. Since tumor phenotype is driven by its genotype and thus indirectly defines tumoral progression, tumor characterization using machine learning and deep learning algorithms will allow us to monitor molecular expression noninvasively, anticipate therapeutic failure, and lead therapeutic management. To follow this path, quality standards have to be set: standardization of imaging acquisition as it has been done in the field of biology, transparency of the model development as it should be reproducible by different institutions, validation, and testing through a high-quality process using large and complex open databases and better interpretability of these algorithms."

abstract = "Purpose
The purpose of this study was to improve the transcription of patient information from imaging study requisitions to the radiology information database at a single institution.
Methods
Five hundred radiology reports from adult outpatient radiographic examinations were chosen randomly from the radiology information system (RIS) and categorized according to their degree of concordance with their corresponding clinical order indications. The number and types of grammatical errors and types of order forms were also recorded. Countermeasures centered on the education of the technical staff and referring physician offices and the implementation of a checklist. Another sample of 500 reports was taken after the implementation of the countermeasures and compared with the baseline data using a χ2 test.
Results
The number of RIS indications perfectly concordant with their corresponding clinical order indications increased from 232 (46.4%) to 314 (62.8%) after the implementation of the countermeasures (P < .0001). The number of partially concordant matches due to inadequate RIS indications dropped from 162 (32.4%) to 114 (22.8%) (P < .001), whereas the number of partially concordant matches due to inadequate clinical order indications increased from 22 (4.4%) to 57 (11.4%) (P < .0001). The number of discordant pairings dropped from 84 (16.8%) to 15 (3%) (P < .0001). Technologists began to input additional patient information obtained from the patients (not present in the image requisitions) in the RIS after the implementation of the countermeasures.
Conclusions
The education of technical staff members and the implementation of a checklist markedly improved the information provided to radiologists on image requisitions from referring providers."

abstract = "Background and objectives
Medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention problems are increasingly being addressed with deep-learning-based solutions. Established deep-learning platforms are flexible but do not provide specific functionality for medical image analysis and adapting them for this domain of application requires substantial implementation effort. Consequently, there has been substantial duplication of effort and incompatible infrastructure developed across many research groups. This work presents the open-source NiftyNet platform for deep learning in medical imaging. The ambition of NiftyNet is to accelerate and simplify the development of these solutions, and to provide a common mechanism for disseminating research outputs for the community to use, adapt and build upon.
Methods
The NiftyNet infrastructure provides a modular deep-learning pipeline for a range of medical imaging applications including segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications. Components of the NiftyNet pipeline including data loading, data augmentation, network architectures, loss functions and evaluation metrics are tailored to, and take advantage of, the idiosyncracies of medical image analysis and computer-assisted intervention. NiftyNet is built on the TensorFlow framework and supports features such as TensorBoard visualization of 2D and 3D images and computational graphs by default.
Results
We present three illustrative medical image analysis applications built using NiftyNet infrastructure: (1) segmentation of multiple abdominal organs from computed tomography; (2) image regression to predict computed tomography attenuation maps from brain magnetic resonance images; and (3) generation of simulated ultrasound images for specified anatomical poses.
Conclusions
The NiftyNet infrastructure enables researchers to rapidly develop and distribute deep learning solutions for segmentation, regression, image generation and representation learning applications, or extend the platform to new applications."

abstract = {Background Before initiating cancer therapy, a diagnostic tumor tissue sample evaluated within a pathology laboratory by a pathologist is essential to confirm the malignancy type and provide key prognostic factors that direct the treatment offered. Methods Pathology evaluation includes multiple expensive reagents, complex equipment, and both laboratory and pathologist technical skills. By using breast cancer as an example, at a minimum, key tumor prognostic information required before the initiation of treatment includes subtype, tumor grade, tumor size, lymph node status when possible, and biomarker expression determined by immunohistochemistry for estrogen receptor. The additional determination of biomarker expression of progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2) is the standard of care in high-resource settings, but assays may not be affordable in low-income and middle-income countries. Results With positive tests, patients are eligible for either tamoxifen (for estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive cancers) or monoclonal antibody therapy (for HER2-positive cancers). For settings in which endocrine therapy and/or HER2-targeted therapy is unavailable, biomarker studies have no utility, and high-resource setting standards for pathology evaluation and reporting are unachievable. Resource-stratified pathology evaluation guidelines in cancer diagnosis have not been developed, in contrast to excellent comprehensive, resource-stratified clinical guidelines for use in low-income and middle-income countries, and these are long overdue. Conclusions The challenges of pathology evaluation in the context of global health are being met by innovative solutions, which may change the face of pathology practice.},

The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer has incorporated documentation of critical elements outlined in Operative Standards for Cancer Surgery into revised standards for cancer center accreditation. This study assessed the current documentation of critical elements in partial mastectomy (PM) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) operative reports.
Materials and methods
Operative reports for PM + SLNB at a single academic institution from 2013 to 2018 were reviewed for compliance and surveyor interobserver reliability with the Oncologic Elements of Operative Record defined in Operative Standards and compared with a nonredundant American Society of Breast Surgeons Mastery of Breast Surgery (MBS) quality measure for specimen orientation.
Results
Ten reviewers each evaluated 66 PM + SLNB operative reports for 13 Oncologic Elements and one MBS measure. No operative records reported all critical elements for PM + SLNB or PM alone. Residents completed 36.4% of operative reports: Element documentation was similar for PM but varied significantly for SLNB between resident and attending authorship. Combined reporting performance and interrater reliability varied across all elements and was highest for the use of SLNB tracer (97.1% and κ = 0.95, respectively) and lowest for intraoperative assessment of SLNB (30.6%, κ = 0.43). MBS specimen orientation had both high proportion reported (87.0%) and interrater reliability (κ = 0.84).
Conclusions
Adherence to reporting critical elements for PM and SLNB varied. Whether differential compliance was tied to discrepancies in documentation or reviewer abstraction, clarification of synoptic choices may improve reporting consistency. Evolving techniques or technologies will require continuous appraisal of mandated reporting for breast surgery."

To further the development of such methods, we propose a two-stream model for endoscopic image analysis. Our model fuses two streams of deep feature inputs by mapping their inherent relations through a novel relational network model, to better model symptoms and classify the image. In contrast to handcrafted feature-based models, our proposed network is able to learn features automatically and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on two public datasets: KVASIR and Nerthus. Our extensive evaluations illustrate the importance of having two streams of inputs instead of a single stream and also demonstrates the merits of the proposed relational network architecture to combine those streams.",

Purpose To investigate whether CAD-extracted kinetic features of breast cancer and the heterogeneity of these features at preoperative MRI are associated with distant metastasis-free survival in women with invasive breast cancer. Materials and Methods Consecutive women with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative MRI were retrospectively evaluated between 2011 and 2012. A commercially available CAD system was used to extract the peak enhancement and delayed enhancement profiles of each breast cancer case from preoperative MRI data. The kinetic heterogeneity of these features (a measure of heterogeneity in the proportions of tumor pixels with delayed washout, plateau, and persistent components within a tumor) was calculated to evaluate intratumoral heterogeneity. Cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the associations between CAD-extracted kinetic features and distant metastasis-free survival after adjusting for clinical-pathologic factors. Results A total of 276 consecutive women (mean age, 53 years) were evaluated. In 28 of 276 (10.1\%) women, distant metastasis developed at a median follow-up of 79 months. A higher degree of kinetic heterogeneity was observed in women with distant metastases than in those without distant metastases (mean, 0.70 ± 0.2 vs 0.43 ± 0.3; P < .001). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that a higher degree of kinetic heterogeneity (hazard ratio [HR], 19.2; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2, 87.1; P < .001), higher peak enhancement (HR, 1.001; 95\% CI: 1.000, 1.002; P = .045), the presence of lymphovascular invasion (HR, 3.3; 95\% CI: 1.5, 7.5; P = .004), and a higher histologic grade (ie, grade 3) (HR, 2.2; 95\% CI: 1.0, 4.9; P = .044) were associated with worse distant metastasis-free survival. Conclusion Higher values of kinetic heterogeneity and peak enhancement as determined with computer-aided diagnosis of preoperative MRI were associated with worse distant metastasis-free survival in women with invasive breast cancer. © RSNA, 2020 See also the editorial by El Khouli and Jacobs in this issue.},

abstract = {Although rapid advances in machine learning have made it increasingly applicable to expert decision-making, the delivery of accurate algorithmic predictions alone is insufficient for effective human-AI collaboration. In this work, we investigate the key types of information medical experts desire when they are first introduced to a diagnostic AI assistant. In a qualitative lab study, we interviewed 21 pathologists before, during, and after being presented deep neural network (DNN) predictions for prostate cancer diagnosis, to learn the types of information that they desired about the AI assistant. Our findings reveal that, far beyond understanding the local, case-specific reasoning behind any model decision, clinicians desired upfront information about basic, global properties of the model, such as its known strengths and limitations, its subjective point-of-view, and its overall design objective--what it's designed to be optimized for. Participants compared these information needs to the collaborative mental models they develop of their medical colleagues when seeking a second opinion: the medical perspectives and standards that those colleagues embody, and the compatibility of those perspectives with their own diagnostic patterns. These findings broaden and enrich discussions surrounding AI transparency for collaborative decision-making, providing a richer understanding of what experts find important in their introduction to AI assistants before integrating them into routine practice.},

abstract="Computer Vision, and hence Artificial Intelligence-based extraction of information from images, has increasingly received attention over the last years, for instance in medical diagnostics. While the algorithms' complexity is a reason for their increased performance, it also leads to the `black box' problem, consequently decreasing trust towards AI. In this regard, ``Explainable Artificial Intelligence'' (XAI) allows to open that black box and to improve the degree of AI transparency. In this paper, we first discuss the theoretical impact of explainability on trust towards AI, followed by showcasing how the usage of XAI in a health-related setting can look like. More specifically, we show how XAI can be applied to understand why Computer Vision, based on deep learning, did or did not detect a disease (malaria) on image data (thin blood smear slide images). Furthermore, we investigate, how XAI can be used to compare the detection strategy of two different deep learning models often used for Computer Vision: Convolutional Neural Network and Multi-Layer Perceptron. Our empirical results show that i) the AI sometimes used questionable or irrelevant data features of an image to detect malaria (even if correctly predicted), and ii) that there may be significant discrepancies in how different deep learning models explain the same prediction. Our theoretical discussion highlights that XAI can support trust in Computer Vision systems, and AI systems in general, especially through an increased understandability and predictability.",

Understanding the reasons behind predictions and queries is important when assessing how the learner works and, in turn, trust. Consequently, we propose the novel framework of explanatory interactive learning where, in each step, the learner explains its query to the user, and the user interacts by both answering the query and correcting the explanation. We demonstrate that this can boost the predictive and explanatory powers of, and the trust into, the learned model, using text (e.g. SVMs) and image classification (e.g. neural networks) experiments as well as a user study.},

Image annotation is one of the main activity of dermatologists and the quality of annotation depends on the physician experience and on the number of studied cases: manual annotations are very useful to extract features like contours, intersections and shapes that can be used in the processes of lesion segmentation and classification made by automatic agents. This paper proposes the design of an interactive multimedia platform that enhance the annotation process of medical images, in the domain of dermatology, adopting gamification and "games with a purpose" (GWAP) strategies in order to improve the engagement and the production of qualified datasets also fostering their sharing and practical evaluation. A special attention is given to the design choices, theories and assumptions as well as the implementation and technological details.},

Empirical research diagnosed poor contextual fit as the cause. This paper describes the design and field evaluation of a radically new form of DST. It automatically generates slides for clinicians' decision meetings with subtly embedded machine prognostics. This design took inspiration from the notion of Unremarkable Computing, that by augmenting the users' routines technology/AI can have significant importance for the users yet remain unobtrusive. Our field evaluation suggests clinicians are more likely to encounter and embrace such a DST. Drawing on their responses, we discuss the importance and intricacies of finding the right level of unremarkableness in DST design, and share lessons learned in prototyping critical AI systems as a situated experience.},

abstract = {Background Recent advances in machine and deep learning based on an increased availability of clinical data have fueled renewed interest in computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). CDSSs have shown great potential to improve healthcare, increase patient safety and reduce costs. However, the use of CDSSs is not without pitfalls, as an inadequate or faulty CDSS can potentially deteriorate the quality of healthcare and put patients at risk. In addition, the adoption of a CDSS might fail because its intended users ignore the output of the CDSS due to lack of trust, relevancy or actionability. Aim In this article, we provide guidance based on literature for the different aspects involved in the adoption of a CDSS with a special focus on machine and deep learning based systems: selection, acceptance testing, commissioning, implementation and quality assurance. Results A rigorous selection process will help identify the CDSS that best fits the preferences and requirements of the local site. Acceptance testing will make sure that the selected CDSS fulfills the defined specifications and satisfies the safety requirements. The commissioning process will prepare the CDSS for safe clinical use at the local site. An effective implementation phase should result in an orderly roll out of the CDSS to the well-trained end-users whose expectations have been managed. And finally, quality assurance will make sure that the performance of the CDSS is maintained and that any issues are promptly identified and solved. Conclusion We conclude that a systematic approach to the adoption of a CDSS will help avoid pitfalls, improve patient safety and increase the chances of success.},

abstract = {Computer vision technology is being used by many but remains representative of only a few. People have reported misbehavior of computer vision models, including offensive prediction results and lower performance for underrepresented groups. Current computer vision models are typically developed using datasets consisting of manually annotated images or videos; the data and label distributions in these datasets are critical to the models' behavior. In this paper, we examine ImageNet, a large-scale ontology of images that has spurred the development of many modern computer vision methods. We consider three key factors within the person subtree of ImageNet that may lead to problematic behavior in downstream computer vision technology: (1) the stagnant concept vocabulary of WordNet, (2) the attempt at exhaustive illustration of all categories with images, and (3) the inequality of representation in the images within concepts. We seek to illuminate the root causes of these concerns and take the first steps to mitigate them constructively.},

abstract = {Trained machine learning models are increasingly used to perform high-impact tasks in areas such as law enforcement, medicine, education, and employment. In order to clarify the intended use cases of machine learning models and minimize their usage in contexts for which they are not well suited, we recommend that released models be accompanied by documentation detailing their performance characteristics. In this paper, we propose a framework that we call model cards, to encourage such transparent model reporting. Model cards are short documents accompanying trained machine learning models that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type [15]) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type) that are relevant to the intended application domains. Model cards also disclose the context in which models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. While we focus primarily on human-centered machine learning models in the application fields of computer vision and natural language processing, this framework can be used to document any trained machine learning model. To solidify the concept, we provide cards for two supervised models: One trained to detect smiling faces in images, and one trained to detect toxic comments in text. We propose model cards as a step towards the responsible democratization of machine learning and related artificial intelligence technology, increasing transparency into how well artificial intelligence technology works. We hope this work encourages those releasing trained machine learning models to accompany model releases with similar detailed evaluation numbers and other relevant documentation.},

We find that people's trust in a model is affected by both its stated accuracy and its observed accuracy, and that the effect of stated accuracy can change depending on the observed accuracy.

In this paper, we use influence functions — a classic technique from robust statistics — to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up influence functions to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to influence functions can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that influence functions are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.},

Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one.In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally varound the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

The sheer number of ways humans represent and misrepresent information about real-world entities makes ER a challenging problem. Deep Learning (DL) has provided impressive results in the field of natural language processing, thus recent works started exploring DL approaches to the ER problem, with encouraging results. However, we are still far from understanding why and when these approaches work in the ER setting. We are developing a methodology, Mojito, to produce explainable interpretations of the output of DL models for the ER task. Our methodology is based on LIME, a popular tool for producing prediction explanations for generic classification tasks. In this paper we report our first experiences in interpreting recent DL models for the ER task. Our results demonstrate the importance of explanations in the DL space, and suggest that, when assessing performance of DL algorithms for ER, accuracy alone may not be sufficient to demonstrate generality and reproducibility in a production environment.},

In addition, many systems, such as image classifiers, operate on low-level features rather than high-level concepts. To address these challenges, we introduce Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs), which provide an interpretation of a neural net’s internal state in terms of human-friendly concepts. The key idea is to view the high-dimensional internal state of a neural net as an aid, not an obstacle. We show how to use CAVs as part of a technique, Testing with CAVs (TCAV), that uses directional derivatives to quantify the degree to which a user-defined concept is important to a classification result–for example, how sensitive a prediction of “zebra” is to the presence of stripes. Using the domain of image classification as a testing ground, we describe how CAVs may be used to explore hypotheses and generate insights for a standard image classification network as well as a medical application.} }

Results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. We provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. Our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis.},

We developed a system allowing graders to review images remotely and asynchronously. For both TA and TA-F approaches, images with disagreement were reviewed by all graders in a round-robin fashion until disagreements were resolved. Five panels of three retina specialists each adjudicated a set of 499 retinal fundus images (1 panel using Baseline, 2 using TA, and 2 using TA-F adjudication). Reliability was measured as grade agreement among the panels using Cohen's quadratically weighted kappa. Efficiency was measured as the number of rounds needed to reach a consensus for tool-based adjudication.    The grades from remote, tool-based adjudication showed high agreement with the Baseline procedure, with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.948 and 0.943 for the two TA panels, and 0.921 and 0.963 for the two TA-F panels. Cases adjudicated using TA-F were resolved in fewer rounds compared with TA (P \\&lt; 0.001; standard permutation test).    Remote, tool-based adjudication presents a flexible and reliable alternative to in-person adjudication for DR diagnosis. Feature-based rubrics can help accelerate consensus for tool-based adjudication of DR without compromising label quality.

Fuzzy logic can help reduce the difficulties faced by computational systems to represent and simulate the reasoning and the style adopted by radiologists in the process of medical image analysis. The study described in this paper consists of a new method that applies fuzzy logic concepts to improve the representation of features related to image description in order to make it semantically more consistent. Specifically, we have developed a computer-aided diagnosis tool for automatic BI-RADS categorization of breast lesions. The user provides parameters such as contour, shape and density and the system gives a suggestion about the BI-RADS classification.
Methods
Initially, values of malignancy were defined for each image descriptor, according to the BI-RADS standard. When analyzing contour, for example, our method considers the matching of features and linguistic variables. Next, we created the fuzzy inference system. The generation of membership functions was carried out by the Fuzzy Omega algorithm, which is based on the statistical analysis of the dataset. This algorithm maps the distribution of different classes in a set.
Results
Images were analyzed by a group of physicians and the resulting evaluations were submitted to the Fuzzy Omega algorithm. The results were compared, achieving an accuracy of 76.67% for nodules and 83.34% for calcifications.
Conclusions
The fit of definitions and linguistic rules to numerical models provided by our method can lead to a tighter connection between the specialist and the computer system, yielding more effective and reliable results."

In modern clinical practice, digital pathology has a crucial role and is increasingly a technological requirement in the scientific laboratory environment. The advent of whole-slide imaging, availability of faster networks, and cheaper storage solutions has made it easier for pathologists to manage digital slide images and share them for clinical use. In parallel, unprecedented advances in machine learning have enabled the synergy of artificial intelligence and digital pathology, which offers image-based diagnosis possibilities that were once limited only to radiology and cardiology. Integration of digital slides into the pathology workflow, advanced algorithms, and computer-aided diagnostic techniques extend the frontiers of the pathologist's view beyond a microscopic slide and enable true utilisation and integration of knowledge that is beyond human limits and boundaries, and we believe there is clear potential for artificial intelligence breakthroughs in the pathology setting. In this Review, we discuss advancements in digital slide-based image diagnosis for cancer along with some challenges and opportunities for artificial intelligence in digital pathology."

Image reporting is a vital component of patient management depending on individual radiologists' performance. Our objective was to explore mammographic diagnostic efficacy in a country where breast cancer screening does not exist.
Materials and Methods
Two mammographic test sets were used: a typical screening (TS) and high-difficulty (HD) test set. Nonscreening (NS) radiologists (n = 11) read both test sets, while 52 and 49 screening radiologists read the TS and HD test sets, respectively. The screening radiologists were classified into two groups: a less experienced (LE) group with ≤5 years' experience and a more experienced (ME) group with ≥5 years' experience. A Kruskal–Wallis and Tukey–Kramer post hoc test were used to compare reading performance among reader groups, and the Wilcoxon matched pairs tests was used to compare TS and ND test sets for the NS radiologists.
Results
Across the three reader groups, there were significant differences in case sensitivity (χ2 [2] = 9.4, P = .008), specificity (χ2 [2] = 10.3, P = .006), location sensitivity (χ2 [2] = 19.8, P < .001), receiver operating characteristics, area under the curve (χ2 [2] = 19.7, P < .001) and jack-knife free-response receiver operating characteristics (JAFROCs) (χ2 [2] = 18.1, P < .001). NS performance for all measured scores was significantly lower than those for the ME readers (P < .006), while only location sensitivity was lower (χ2 [2] = 17.5, P = .026) for the NS compared to the LE group. No other significant differences were observed.
Conclusion
Large variations in mammographic performance exist between radiologists from screening and nonscreening countries."

abstract = "Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential in medical image enhancement problems, such as super-resolution or image synthesis. However, to date, most existing approaches are based on deterministic models, neglecting the presence of different sources of uncertainty in such problems. Here we introduce methods to characterise different components of uncertainty, and demonstrate the ideas using diffusion MRI super-resolution. Specifically, we propose to account for intrinsic uncertainty through a heteroscedastic noise model and for parameter uncertainty through approximate Bayesian inference, and integrate the two to quantify predictive uncertainty over the output image. Moreover, we introduce a method to propagate the predictive uncertainty on a multi-channelled image to derived scalar parameters, and separately quantify the effects of intrinsic and parameter uncertainty therein. The methods are evaluated for super-resolution of two different signal representations of diffusion MR images—Diffusion Tensor images and Mean Apparent Propagator MRI—and their derived quantities such as mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy, on multiple datasets of both healthy and pathological human brains. Results highlight three key potential benefits of modelling uncertainty for improving the safety of DL-based image enhancement systems. Firstly, modelling uncertainty improves the predictive performance even when test data departs from training data (“out-of-distribution” datasets). Secondly, the predictive uncertainty highly correlates with reconstruction errors, and is therefore capable of detecting predictive “failures”. Results on both healthy subjects and patients with brain glioma or multiple sclerosis demonstrate that such an uncertainty measure enables subject-specific and voxel-wise risk assessment of the super-resolved images that can be accounted for in subsequent analysis. Thirdly, we show that the method for decomposing predictive uncertainty into its independent sources provides high-level “explanations” for the model performance by separately quantifying how much uncertainty arises from the inherent difficulty of the task or the limited training examples. The introduced concepts of uncertainty modelling extend naturally to many other imaging modalities and data enhancement applications."

The standard practice used in gathering this data minimizes disagreement between annotators, and we have found this results in data that fails to account for the ambiguity inherent in language. We have proposed the CrowdTruth method for collecting ground truth through crowdsourcing, which reconsiders the role of people in machine learning based on the observation that disagreement between annotators provides a useful signal for phenomena such as ambiguity in the text. We report on using this method to build an annotated data set for medical relation extraction for the cause and treat relations, and how this data performed in a supervised training experiment. We demonstrate that by modeling ambiguity, labeled data gathered from crowd workers can (1) reach the level of quality of domain experts for this task while reducing the cost, and (2) provide better training data at scale than distant supervision. We further propose and validate new weighted measures for precision, recall, and F-measure, which account for ambiguity in both human and machine performance on this task.},

We designed and implemented a structured adjudication system that collects graders’ arguments in a machine-readable format without limiting graders’ abilities to provide free-form justifications for their classification decisions.

This raises the question of how AI assistants should be designed to handle the classification of ambiguous cases. Our study compared two AI assistants that provide classification labels for medical time series data along with quantitative uncertainty estimates: conventional vs. ambiguity-aware. We simulated our ambiguity-aware AI based on real-world expert discussions to highlight cases likely to lead to expert disagreement, and to present arguments for conflicting classification choices. Our results demonstrate that ambiguity-aware AI can alter expert workflows by significantly increasing the proportion of contentious cases reviewed. We also found that the relevance of AI-provided arguments (selected from guidelines either randomly or by experts) affected experts' accuracy at revising AI-suggested labels. Our work contributes a novel perspective on the design of AI for contentious clinical assessments.},

To do so, we develop an algorithm-informed XAI question bank in which user needs for explainability are represented as prototypical questions users might ask about the AI, and use it as a study probe. Our work contributes insights into the design space of XAI, informs efforts to support design practices in this space, and identifies opportunities for future XAI work.

In this work, we show that machine learning models can be successfully trained to give uncertainty scores to data instances that result in high expert disagreements. In particular, they can identify patient cases that would benefit most from a medical second opinion. Our central methodological finding is that Direct Uncertainty Prediction (DUP), training a model to predict an uncertainty score directly from the raw patient features, works better than Uncertainty Via Classification, the two step process of training a classifier and postprocessing the output distribution to give an uncertainty score. We show this both with a theoretical result, and on extensive evaluations on a large scale medical imaging application.}

Pooling multiple physicians’ diagnoses (collective intelligence) is a promising approach to reducing misdiagnoses, but its accuracy in clinical cases is unknown to date.To assess how the diagnostic accuracy of groups of physicians and trainees compares with the diagnostic accuracy of individual physicians.Cross-sectional study using data from the Human Diagnosis Project (Human Dx), a multicountry data set of ranked differential diagnoses by individual physicians, graduate trainees, and medical students (users) solving user-submitted, structured clinical cases. From May 7, 2014, to October 5, 2016, groups of 2 to 9 randomly selected physicians solved individual cases. Data analysis was performed from March 16, 2017, to July 30, 2018.The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, assessed as a correct diagnosis in the top 3 ranked diagnoses for an individual; for groups, the top 3 diagnoses were a collective differential generated using a weighted combination of user diagnoses with a variety of approaches. A version of the McNemar test was used to account for clustering across repeated solvers to compare diagnostic accuracy.Of the 2069 users solving 1572 cases from the Human Dx data set, 1228 (59.4\\%) were residents or fellows, 431 (20.8\\%) were attending physicians, and 410 (19.8\\%) were medical students.

abstract="In this paper we introduce the CrowdTruth open-source software framework for machine-human computation, that implements a novel approach to gathering human annotation data for a variety of media (e.g. text, image, video). The CrowdTruth approach embodied in the software captures human semantics through a pipeline of four processes: a) combining various machine processing of media in order to better understand the input content and optimize its suitability for micro-tasks, thus optimize the time and cost of the crowdsourcing process; b) providing reusable human-computing task templates to collect the maximum diversity in the human interpretation, thus collect richer human semantics; c) implementing 'disagreement metrics', i.e. CrowdTruth metrics, to support deep analysis of the quality and semantics of the crowdsourcing data; and d) providing an interface to support data and results visualization. Instead of the traditional inter-annotator agreement, we use their disagreement as a useful signal to evaluate the data quality, ambiguity and vagueness. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of this approach to a variety of problems across multiple domains. Moreover, we show the advantages of using open standards and the extensibility of the framework with new data modalities and annotation tasks.",

In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for building human-centered, decision-theory-driven XAI based on an extensive review across these fields. Drawing on this framework, we identify pathways along which human cognitive patterns drives needs for building XAI and how XAI can mitigate common cognitive biases. We then put this framework into practice by designing and implementing an explainable clinical diagnostic tool for intensive care phenotyping and conducting a co-design exercise with clinicians. Thereafter, we draw insights into how this framework bridges algorithm-generated explanations and human decision-making theories. Finally, we discuss implications for XAI design and development.},

abstract = "Background
There is significant institutional variation in the surgical care of breast cancer, and this may reflect access to services and resultant physician practice patterns. In previous studies, specialty care has been associated with variation in the operative treatment of breast cancer but has not been evaluated in a community setting. This study investigates these issues in a cohort of 59 community hospitals in the United States.
Materials and methods
Data on patients receiving an operation for breast cancer (2006-2009) in a large, geographically diverse cohort of hospitals were obtained. Administrative data, autoabstracted cancer-specific variables from free text, and multiple other data sets were combined. Polymotous logistic regression with multilevel outcomes identified associations between these variables and surgical treatment.
Results
At 59 community hospitals, 4766 patients underwent breast conserving surgery (BCS), mastectomy, or mastectomy with reconstruction. The older patients were most likely to receive mastectomy alone, whereas the younger age group underwent more reconstruction (age <50), and BCS was most likely in patients aged 50-65. Surgical procedure also varied according to tumor characteristics. BCS was more likely at smaller hospitals, those with ambulatory surgery centers, and those located in nonmetropolitan areas. The likelihood of reconstruction doubled when there were more reconstructive surgeons in the health services area (P = 0.02). BCS was more likely when radiation oncology services were available within the hospital or network (P = 0.04).
Conclusions
Interpretation of these results for practice redesign is not straightforward. Although access to specialty care is statistically associated with type of breast surgical procedure, clinical impact is limited. It may be more effective to target other aspects of care to ensure each patient receives treatment consistent with her individual preferences."

Telemedicine has been tested in multiple clinical settings, demonstrating at least equivalency to in-person care and high levels of patient and health professional satisfaction.

Telepathology is critical to cancer care and may be accomplished synchronously and asynchronously for both cytology and tissue diagnoses. Mobile applications support symptom management, lifestyle modification, and medication adherence as a tool for home-based care. Telemedicine can support the oncologist with access to interactive tele-education. Teleoncology practice should maintain in-person professional standards, including documentation integrated into the patient’s electronic health record. Telemedicine training is essential to facilitate rapport, maximize engagement, and conduct an accurate virtual exam. With the appropriate attachments, the only limitation to the virtual exam is palpation. The national telehealth resource centers can provide interested clinicians with the latest information on telemedicine reimbursement, parity, and practice. To experience the gains of teleoncology, appropriate training, education, as well as paying close attention to gaps, such as those inherent in the digital divide, are essential.},

abstract = "Summary
Background
Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning algorithms versus health-care professionals in classifying diseases using medical imaging.
Methods
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for studies published from Jan 1, 2012, to June 6, 2019. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals based on medical imaging, for any disease, were included. We excluded studies that used medical waveform data graphics material or investigated the accuracy of image segmentation rather than disease classification. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample external validation were included in a meta-analysis, using a unified hierarchical model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018091176.
Findings
Our search identified 31 587 studies, of which 82 (describing 147 patient cohorts) were included. 69 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 9·7% to 100·0% (mean 79·1%, SD 0·2) and specificity ranging from 38·9% to 100·0% (mean 88·3%, SD 0·1). An out-of-sample external validation was done in 25 studies, of which 14 made the comparison between deep learning models and health-care professionals in the same sample. Comparison of the performance between health-care professionals in these 14 studies, when restricting the analysis to the contingency table for each study reporting the highest accuracy, found a pooled sensitivity of 87·0% (95% CI 83·0–90·2) for deep learning models and 86·4% (79·9–91·0) for health-care professionals, and a pooled specificity of 92·5% (95% CI 85·1–96·4) for deep learning models and 90·5% (80·6–95·7) for health-care professionals.
Interpretation
Our review found the diagnostic performance of deep learning models to be equivalent to that of health-care professionals. However, a major finding of the review is that few studies presented externally validated results or compared the performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals using the same sample. Additionally, poor reporting is prevalent in deep learning studies, which limits reliable interpretation of the reported diagnostic accuracy. New reporting standards that address specific challenges of deep learning could improve future studies, enabling greater confidence in the results of future evaluations of this promising technology.

ABSTRACT = {The herpesvirus, polyomavirus, papillomavirus, and retrovirus families are associated with breast cancer. More effort is needed to assess the role of these viruses in the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer cases in women. The aim of this paper is to propose an efficient segmentation and classification system in the Mammography Image Analysis Society (MIAS) images of medical images. Segmentation became challenging for medical images because they are not illuminated in the correct way. The role of segmentation is essential in concern with detecting syndromes in human. This research work is on the segmentation of medical images based on intuitionistic possibilistic fuzzy c-mean (IPFCM) clustering. Intuitionist fuzzy c-mean (IFCM) and possibilistic fuzzy c-mean (PFCM) algorithms are hybridised to deal with problems of fuzzy c-mean. The introduced clustering methodology, in this article, retains the positive points of PFCM which helps to overcome the problem of the coincident clusters, thus the noise and less sensitivity to the outlier. The IPFCM improves the fundamentals of fuzzy c-mean by using intuitionist fuzzy sets. For the clustering of mammogram images for breast cancer detector of abnormal images, IPFCM technique has been applied. The proposed method has been compared with other available fuzzy clustering methods to prove the efficacy of the proposed approach. We compared support vector machine (SVM), decision tree (DT), rough set data analysis (RSDA) and Fuzzy-SVM classification algorithms for achieving an optimal classification result. The outcomes of the studies show that the proposed approach is highly effective with clustering and also with classification of breast cancer. The performance average segmentation accuracy for MIAS images with different noise level 5%, 7% and 9% of IPFCM is 91.25%, 87.50% and 85.30% accordingly. The average classification accuracy rates of the methods (Otsu, Fuzzy c-mean, IFCM, PFCM and IPFCM) for Fuzzy-SVM are 79.69%, 92.19%, 93.13%, 95.00%, and 98.85%, respectively.},

abstract = "Breast Cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer death in women, representing a very complex disease with varied molecular alterations. To assist breast cancer prognosis, the classification of patients into biological groups is of great significance for treatment strategies. Recent studies have used an ensemble of multiple clustering algorithms to elucidate the most characteristic biological groups of breast cancer. However, the combination of various clustering methods resulted in a number of patients remaining unclustered. Therefore, a framework still needs to be developed which can assign as many unclustered (i.e. biologically diverse) patients to one of the identified groups in order to improve classification. Therefore, in this paper we develop a novel classification framework which introduces a new ensemble classification stage after the ensemble clustering stage to target the unclustered patients. Thus, a step-by-step pipeline is introduced which couples ensemble clustering with ensemble classification for the identification of core groups, data distribution in them and improvement in final classification results by targeting the unclustered data. The proposed pipeline is employed on a novel real world breast cancer dataset and subsequently its robustness and stability are examined by testing it on standard datasets. The results show that by using the presented framework, an improved classification is obtained. Finally, the results have been verified using statistical tests, visualisation techniques, cluster quality assessment and interpretation from clinical experts."

abstract = "One in every eight women is susceptible to breast cancer, at some point of time in her life. Early detection and effective treatment is the only rescue to reduce breast cancer mortality. Accurate classification of a breast cancer tumor is an important task in medical diagnosis. Machine learning techniques are gaining importance in medical diagnosis because of their classification capability. In this paper, we propose a new, Genetically Optimized Neural Network (GONN) algorithm, for solving classification problems. We evolve a neural network genetically to optimize its architecture (structure and weight) for classification. We introduce new crossover and mutation operators which differ from standard crossover and mutation operators to reduce the destructive nature of these operators. We use the GONN algorithm to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant. To demonstrate our results, we had taken the WBCD database from UCI Machine Learning repository and compared the classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, ROC curves and AUC under ROC curves of GONN with classical model and classical back propagation model. Our algorithm gives classification accuracy of 98.24%, 99.63% and 100% for 50–50, 60–40, 70–30 training–testing partition respectively and 100% for 10 fold cross validation. The results show that our approach works well with the breast cancer database and can be a good alternative to the well-known machine learning methods."

abstract = {Automatic computer-aided detection plays an important role in biomedical image analysis. Many studies have focused on weak supervised learning as annotation tasks are time-consuming and tedious. Compared with pixel-wise annotation by particular software on the scanned digital high-resolution images, an alternative method of marking out of suspicious regions on microscopy slides is significantly more convenient for pathologists. Additionally, with a focus on dysplasias in the central area, there is a high likelihood of the similar tissues to be found around in clusters. In this paper, for weak annotation on microscopy images, we propose an efficient Foveated Imaging based Multiple Instance Learning (FIMIL) framework to classify weakly-labeled microscopy images. The model also provides multi-scale algorithm for arbitrary image size, in which the patches with highest possibility to contain dysplasia are considered as ”fixation points” in the image. The developed model combines deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multiple instance learning (MIL) for dysplasias detection with only image-level labeling. The benchmark tests are carried out on the marked regions of 40x magnified whole-slide cytology images and the normal/abnormal label and their corresponding possibilities are predicted. Evaluated on the real-life clinical data, our proposed model shows high accuracy and efficiency by weakly-supervised learning. 1},

Despite the new performance highs, the recent advanced segmentation models still require large, representative, and high quality annotated datasets. However, rarely do we have a perfect training dataset, particularly in the field of medical imaging, where data and annotations are both expensive to acquire. Recently, a large body of research has studied the problem of medical image segmentation with imperfect datasets, tackling two major dataset limitations: scarce annotations where only limited annotated data is available for training, and weak annotations where the training data has only sparse annotations, noisy annotations, or image-level annotations. In this article, we provide a detailed review of the solutions above, summarizing both the technical novelties and empirical results. We further compare the benefits and requirements of the surveyed methodologies and provide our recommended solutions. We hope this survey article increases the community awareness of the techniques that are available to handle imperfect medical image segmentation datasets."

To mitigate the negative impact of annotation errors, we propose an adaptive weighted constrained loss that can change the weight of the task-specific penalty term according to the learning process. To impose further supervision about the boundaries, uncertainty-based boundary maps are generated, which can provide better descriptions for the blurry boundaries.

abstract = "Background and objective
Radiologists often have a hard time classifying mammography mass lesions which leads to unnecessary breast biopsies to remove suspicions and this ends up adding exorbitant expenses to an already burdened patient and health care system.
Methods
In this paper we developed a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) system based on deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that aims to help the radiologist classify mammography mass lesions. Deep learning usually requires large datasets to train networks of a certain depth from scratch. Transfer learning is an effective method to deal with relatively small datasets as in the case of medical images, although it can be tricky as we can easily start overfitting.
Results
In this work, we explore the importance of transfer learning and we experimentally determine the best fine-tuning strategy to adopt when training a CNN model. We were able to successfully fine-tune some of the recent, most powerful CNNs and achieved better results compared to other state-of-the-art methods which classified the same public datasets. For instance we achieved 97.35% accuracy and 0.98 AUC on the DDSM database, 95.50% accuracy and 0.97 AUC on the INbreast database and 96.67% accuracy and 0.96 AUC on the BCDR database. Furthermore, after pre-processing and normalizing all the extracted Regions of Interest (ROIs) from the full mammograms, we merged all the datasets to build one large set of images and used it to fine-tune our CNNs. The CNN model which achieved the best results, a 98.94% accuracy, was used as a baseline to build the Breast Cancer Screening Framework. To evaluate the proposed CAD system and its efficiency to classify new images, we tested it on an independent database (MIAS) and got 98.23% accuracy and 0.99 AUC.
Conclusion
The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed framework is performant and can indeed be used to predict if the mass lesions are benign or malignant."

Moreover, the availability of the data is limited, as the health care personnel may not have direct access to stored data. However, medical specialists interact with multimedia content daily through their everyday work and have an increasing interest in finding ways to use it to facilitate their work processes. In this article, we present a novel, holistic multimedia system aiming to tackle automatic analysis of video from gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. The proposed system comprises the whole pipeline, including data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization. It combines filters using machine learning, image recognition, and extraction of global and local image features. The novelty is primarily in this holistic approach and its real-time performance, where we automate a complete algorithmic GI screening process. We built the system in a modular way to make it easily extendable to analyze various abnormalities, and we made it efficient in order to run in real time. The conducted experimental evaluation proves that the detection and localization accuracy are comparable or even better than existing systems, but it is by far leading in terms of real-time performance and efficient resource consumption.},

abstract = "Objective
The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate performance of computer-aided detection (CAD) with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) in detection of breast cancers.
Materials and Methods
CAD was retrospectively applied to standard mammographic views of 127 cases with biopsy proven breast cancers detected with FFDM (Senographe 2000, GE Medical Systems). CAD sensitivity was assessed in total group of 127 cases and for subgroups based on breast density, mammographic lesion type, mammographic lesion size, histopathology and mode of presentation.
Results
Overall CAD sensitivity was 91% (115 of 127 cases). There were no statistical differences (p>0.1) in CAD detection of cancers in dense breasts 90% (53/59) versus non-dense breasts 91% (62/68). There was statistical difference (p<0.05) in CAD detection of cancers that appeared mammographically as microcalcifications only versus other mammographic manifestations. CAD detected 100% (44/44) of cancers manifesting as microcalcifications, 89% (47/53) as no-calcified masses or asymmetries, 88% (14/16) as masses with associated calcifications, and 71% (10/14) as architectural distortions. CAD sensitivity for cancers 1–10mm was 84% (38/45); 11–20mm 93% (55/59); and >20mm 97% (22/23).
Conclusion
CAD applied to FFDM showed 100% sensitivity in identifying cancers manifesting as microcalcifications only and high sensitivity 86% (71/83) for other mammographic appearances of cancer. Sensitivity is influenced by lesion size. CAD in FFDM is an adjunct helping radiologist in early detection of breast cancers."

abstract = {Purpose: To develop a computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme for mass detection on digitized mammograms that achieves a high sensitivity while maintaining a low false positive (FP) rate using morphological enhancement and simple linear iterative clustering (SLIC) method. Methods: The authors developed a multiple stage method for breast mass detection. The proposed CAD scheme consists of five major components: (1) preprocessing based on morphological enhancement, which enhances mass-like patterns while removing unrelated background clutters, (2) segmentation of mass candidates based on the SLIC method, which groups mass and background tissue into different regions, (3) prescreening of suspicious regions using rule-based classification that eliminates regions unlikely to represent masses, (4) potential lesion contour refinement based on distance regularized level set evolution, and (5) FP reduction based on feature extraction and an ensemble of undersampled support vector machines. Two datasets were built to design and evaluate the system: a mass dataset containing 187 cases (386 mammograms) and a nonmass dataset containing 88 mammograms. All cases were acquired from the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). Approximately two thirds of the available masses were used for training the system, and the remaining masses and nonmass dataset were used for testing. Results: Testing of the proposed CAD system on the mass dataset yielded a mass-based sensitivity of 98.55\%, 97.10\%, 92.75\% at 0.84, 0.63, 0.55 FP mark/image, respectively. Tested on the nonmass dataset, the scheme showed a FP rate of 0.55, 0.34, 0.30 mark/image. Conclusions: The results indicate that the system is promising in improving the performance of current CAD systems by reducing FP rate while achieving relatively high sensitivity.},

abstract = "Rationale and Objectives
Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed in the past two decades to assist radiologists in the detection and diagnosis of lesions seen on breast imaging exams, thus providing a second opinion. Mammographic databases play an important role in the development of algorithms aiming at the detection and diagnosis of mammary lesions. However, available databases often do not take into consideration all the requirements needed for research and study purposes. This article aims to present and detail a new mammographic database.
Materials and Methods
Images were acquired at a breast center located in a university hospital (Centro Hospitalar de S. João [CHSJ], Breast Centre, Porto) with the permission of the Portuguese National Committee of Data Protection and Hospital's Ethics Committee. MammoNovation Siemens full-field digital mammography, with a solid-state detector of amorphous selenium was used.
Results
The new database—INbreast—has a total of 115 cases (410 images) from which 90 cases are from women with both breasts affected (four images per case) and 25 cases are from mastectomy patients (two images per case). Several types of lesions (masses, calcifications, asymmetries, and distortions) were included. Accurate contours made by specialists are also provided in XML format.
Conclusion
The strengths of the actually presented database—INbreast—relies on the fact that it was built with full-field digital mammograms (in opposition to digitized mammograms), it presents a wide variability of cases, and is made publicly available together with precise annotations. We believe that this database can be a reference for future works centered or related to breast cancer imaging."

With this newfound ubiquity, ML has moved beyond academia and grown into an engineering discipline. To that end, interpretability tools have been designed to help data scientists and machine learning practitioners better understand how ML models work. However, there has been little evaluation of the extent to which these tools achieve this goal. We study data scientists' use of two existing interpretability tools, the InterpretML implementation of GAMs and the SHAP Python package. We conduct a contextual inquiry (N=11) and a survey (N=197) of data scientists to observe how they use interpretability tools to uncover common issues that arise when building and evaluating ML models. Our results indicate that data scientists over-trust and misuse interpretability tools. Furthermore, few of our participants were able to accurately describe the visualizations output by these tools. We highlight qualitative themes for data scientists' mental models of interpretability tools. We conclude with implications for researchers and tool designers, and contextualize our findings in the social science literature.},

The early diagnosis and prognosis of a cancer type have become a necessity in cancer research, as it can facilitate the subsequent clinical management of patients. The importance of classifying cancer patients into high or low risk groups has led many research teams, from the biomedical and the bioinformatics field, to study the application of machine learning (ML) methods. Therefore, these techniques have been utilized as an aim to model the progression and treatment of cancerous conditions. In addition, the ability of ML tools to detect key features from complex datasets reveals their importance. A variety of these techniques, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Bayesian Networks (BNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Decision Trees (DTs) have been widely applied in cancer research for the development of predictive models, resulting in effective and accurate decision making. Even though it is evident that the use of ML methods can improve our understanding of cancer progression, an appropriate level of validation is needed in order for these methods to be considered in the everyday clinical practice. In this work, we present a review of recent ML approaches employed in the modeling of cancer progression. The predictive models discussed here are based on various supervised ML techniques as well as on different input features and data samples. Given the growing trend on the application of ML methods in cancer research, we present here the most recent publications that employ these techniques as an aim to model cancer risk or patient outcomes."

abstract = {Summary Acromegaly is a chronic disorder usually diagnosed late in the disease evolution. Such delayed diagnosis, together with the inability to achieve the treatment goals of normalizing biochemical disease markers and controlling tumour mass may result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Somatostatin analogues (SSA) are accepted as first-line medical therapy or as second-line therapy in patients undergoing unsuccessful surgery and are considered a cornerstone in the treatment of acromegaly. However, because a high percentage of patients experience SSA medical treatment failure, the identification of biomarkers associated with a successful or unsuccessful response to all classes of medical therapy would help in the choice of treatment and potentially allow for a quicker normalization of biochemical parameters. The current treatment algorithms for acromegaly are based upon a “trial-and-error” approach with additional treatment options provided when disease is not controlled. In many other diseases, therapeutic algorithms have been evolving towards personalized treatment with the medication that best matches individual disease characteristics, using biomarkers that identify therapeutic response. Additionally, a personalized approach to complementary treatment of comorbidities present in the acromegalic patient is also required. This review will discuss the development of a potential treatment algorithm for acromegaly addressing the biochemical control of the disease as well of its associated comorbidities, under a personalized approach based upon markers of prognostic and predictive significance, such as tumour size, MRI adenoma signal, GH value after acute octreotide test, granular adenoma pattern, Ki-67, somatostatin receptor phenotype, aryl hydrocarbon-interacting protein expression, gsp mutations, RAF kinase activity, E-cadherin and beta-arrestin-1.},

Broader notions of radiology as "meaningful work" are largely seen as out of scope for an MTP. The present paper challenges this. In a real-world case with a large MTP, we showed that medical technology could be designed more holistically to explicitly improve radiologists' wellbeing. We first gathered work practices experienced as especially conducive to wellbeing. From there, we distilled ideal practices to increase wellbeing and turned them into two software applications. The MTP's initial skepticism dissolved, while radiologists unanimously emphasized wellbeing and demonstrated how they work towards improving it. Based on our insights, the applications resonated well among the radiologists involved, the healthcare provider, and other customers of the MTP. We close with a critical reflection of the challenges and opportunities of designing wellbeing-driven technology in the work domain.},

ABSTRACT={Medical imaging has evolved from a pure visualization tool to representing a primary source of analytic approaches toward in vivo disease characterization. Hybrid imaging is an integral part of this approach, as it provides complementary visual and quantitative information in the form of morphological and functional insights into the living body. As such, non-invasive imaging modalities no longer provide images only, but data, as stated recently by pioneers in the field. Today, such information, together with other, non-imaging medical data creates highly heterogeneous data sets that underpin the concept of medical big data. While the exponential growth of medical big data challenges their processing, they inherently contain information that benefits a patient-centric personalized healthcare. Novel machine learning approaches combined with high-performance distributed cloud computing technologies help explore medical big data. Such exploration and subsequent generation of knowledge require a profound understanding of the technical challenges. These challenges increase in complexity when employing hybrid, aka dual- or even multi-modality image data as input to big data repositories. This paper provides a general insight into medical big data analysis in light of the use of hybrid imaging information. First, hybrid imaging is introduced (see further contributions to this special Research Topic), also in the context of medical big data, then the technological background of machine learning as well as state-of-the-art distributed cloud computing technologies are presented, followed by the discussion of data preservation and data sharing trends. Joint data exploration endeavors in the context of in vivo radiomics and hybrid imaging will be presented. Standardization challenges of imaging protocol, delineation, feature engineering, and machine learning evaluation will be detailed. Last, the paper will provide an outlook into the future role of hybrid imaging in view of personalized medicine, whereby a focus will be given to the derivation of prediction models as part of clinical decision support systems, to which machine learning approaches and hybrid imaging can be anchored.}

abstract = "Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer among women worldwide. Early detection of breast cancer can increase treatment options and patients' survivability. Mammography is the gold standard for breast imaging and cancer detection. However, due to some limitations of this modality such as low sensitivity especially in dense breasts, other modalities like ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging are often suggested to achieve additional information. Recently, computer-aided detection or diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to help radiologists in order to increase diagnosis accuracy. Generally, a CAD system consists of four stages: (a) preprocessing, (b) segmentation of regions of interest, (c) feature extraction and selection, and finally (d) classification. This paper presents the approaches which are applied to develop CAD systems on mammography and ultrasound images. The performance evaluation metrics of CAD systems are also reviewed."

abstract="Deep convolutional neural networks are powerful tools for learning visual representations from images. However, designing efficient deep architectures to analyse volumetric medical images remains challenging. This work investigates efficient and flexible elements of modern convolutional networks such as dilated convolution and residual connection. With these essential building blocks, we propose a high-resolution, compact convolutional network for volumetric image segmentation. To illustrate its efficiency of learning 3D representation from large-scale image data, the proposed network is validated with the challenging task of parcellating 155 neuroanatomical structures from brain MR images. Our experiments show that the proposed network architecture compares favourably with state-of-the-art volumetric segmentation networks while being an order of magnitude more compact. We consider the brain parcellation task as a pretext task for volumetric image segmentation; our trained network potentially provides a good starting point for transfer learning. Additionally, we show the feasibility of voxel-level uncertainty estimation using a sampling approximation through dropout.",

abstract={Is this paper, the Orthanc open-source software is introduced. Orthanc is a lightweight, yet powerful standalone DICOM store for healthcare and medical research. Multiple instances of Orthanc can easily be deployed in the hospital network or even in the same computer, which simplifies the interconnection between the DICOM modalities and the data management of medical images. Orthanc is unique with respect to the fact that it provides a modern RESTful API: Orthanc can be driven from any computer language to automate clinical processes. Finally, Orthanc comes bundled with an embedded Web interface that allows the end-users to browse and interact with the content of the DICOM store.},

The purpose of this study was to integrate web-based forms with a zero-footprint cloud-based Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) to create a tool of potential benefit to radiology research and education.
Materials and Methods
Web-based forms were created with a front-end and back-end architecture utilizing common programming languages including Vue.js, Node.js and MongoDB, and integrated into an existing zero-footprint cloud-based PACS.
Results
The web-based forms application can be accessed in any modern internet browser on desktop or mobile devices and allows the creation of customizable forms consisting of a variety of questions types. Each form can be linked to an individual DICOM examination or a collection of DICOM examinations.
Conclusions
Several uses are demonstrated through a series of case studies, including implementation of a research platform for multi-reader multi-case (MRMC) studies and other imaging research, and creation of an online Objective Structure Clinical Examination (OSCE) and an educational case file."

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly becoming a tool to enhance various medical image analysis tasks with accuracies comparable to expert clinicians. Computer assisted detection and diagnosis, and image segmentation and registration have significantly benefited from AI. However, integration of AI into the clinical workflow has been slow due to requirements for libraries that are specific to each model, and also environments that are specific to clinical centers. These challenges demonstrate the need for an AI-based solution that can be integrated into any environment with minimum hardware and software overhead. Tesseract-Medical Imaging (Tesseract-MI) is an open-source, web-based platform which enables deployment of AI models while simultaneously providing standard image viewing and reporting schemes. The goal of Tesseract-MI is to augment 3D medical imaging and provide a 4<sup>th</sup> dimension (AI) when requested by a user. As a case study, we demonstrate the utility of our platform and present ProstateCancer.ai, a web application for identification of clinically significant prostate cancer in MRI.},

  abstract  = {We propose a new method for breast cancer screening from DCE-MRI based on a post-hoc approach that is trained using weakly annotated data (i.e., labels are available only at the image level without any lesion delineation). Our proposed post-hoc method automatically diagnosis the whole volume and, for positive cases, it localizes the malignant lesions that led to such diagnosis. Conversely, traditional approaches follow a pre-hoc approach that initially localises suspicious areas that are subsequently classified to establish the breast malignancy – this approach is trained using strongly annotated data (i.e., it needs a delineation and classification of all lesions in an image). We also aim to establish the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches when applied to breast screening from DCE-MRI. Relying on experiments on a breast DCE-MRI dataset that contains scans of 117 patients, our results show that the post-hoc method is more accurate for diagnosing the whole volume per patient, achieving an AUC of 0.91, while the pre-hoc method achieves an AUC of 0.81. However, the performance for localising the malignant lesions remains challenging for the post-hoc method due to the weakly labelled dataset employed during training.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a web-based open source tool and a method for generating insight from any text or discourse using text network analysis. The tool (InfraNodus) can be used by researchers and writers to organize and to better understand their notes, to measure the level of bias in discourse, and to identify the parts of the discourse where there is a potential for insight and new ideas. The method is based on text network analysis algorithm, which represents any text as a network and identifies the most influential words in a discourse based on the terms' co-occurrence. Graph community detection algorithm is then applied in order to identify the different topical clusters, which represent the main topics in the text as well as the relations between them. The community structure is used in conjunction with other measures to identify the level of bias or cognitive diversity of the discourse. Finally, the structural gaps in the graph can indicate the parts of the discourse where the connections are lacking, therefore highlighting the areas where there's a potential for new ideas. The tool can be used as stand-alone software by end users as well as implemented via an API into other tools. Another interesting application is in the field of recommendation systems: structural gaps could indicate potentially interesting non-trivial connections to any connected datasets.},

abstract = {Humans can easily find themselves in high cost situations where they must choose between suggestions made by an automated decision aid and a conflicting human decision aid. Previous research indicates that humans often rely on automation or other humans, but not both simultaneously. Expanding on previous work conducted by Lyons and Stokes (2012), the current experiment measures how trust in automated or human decision aids differs along with perceived risk and workload. The simulated task required 126 participants to choose the safest route for a military convoy; they were presented with conflicting information from an automated tool and a human. Results demonstrated that as workload increased, trust in automation decreased. As the perceived risk increased, trust in the human decision aid increased. Individual differences in dispositional trust correlated with an increased trust in both decision aids. These findings can be used to inform training programs for operators who may receive information from human and automated sources. Examples of this context include: air traffic control, aviation, and signals intelligence.},

abstract="The training of medical image analysis systems using machine learning approaches follows a common script: collect and annotate a large dataset, train the classifier on the training set, and test it on a hold-out test set. This process bears no direct resemblance with radiologist training, which is based on solving a series of tasks of increasing difficulty, where each task involves the use of significantly smaller datasets than those used in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel training approach inspired by how radiologists are trained. In particular, we explore the use of meta-training that models a classifier based on a series of tasks. Tasks are selected using teacher-student curriculum learning, where each task consists of simple classification problems containing small training sets. We hypothesize that our proposed meta-training approach can be used to pre-train medical image analysis models. This hypothesis is tested on the automatic breast screening classification from DCE-MRI trained with weakly labeled datasets. The classification performance achieved by our approach is shown to be the best in the field for that application, compared to state of art baseline approaches: DenseNet, multiple instance learning and multi-task learning.",

abstract = {Abstract Recent estimates of global cancer incidence and survival were used to update previous figures of limited duration prevalence to the year 2008. The number of patients with cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2008 who were still alive at the end of 2008 in the adult population is described by world region, country and the human development index. The 5-year global cancer prevalence is estimated to be 28.8 million in 2008. Close to half of the prevalence burden is in areas of very high human development that comprise only one-sixth of the world's population. Breast cancer continues to be the most prevalent cancer in the vast majority of countries globally; cervix cancer is the most prevalent cancer in much of Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia and prostate cancer dominates in North America, Oceania and Northern and Western Europe. Stomach cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Eastern Asia (including China); oral cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer in Indian men and Kaposi sarcoma has the highest 5-year prevalence among men in 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The methods used to estimate point prevalence appears to give reasonable results at the global level. The figures highlight the need for long-term care targeted at managing patients with certain very frequently diagnosed cancer forms. To be of greater relevance to cancer planning, the estimation of other time-based measures of global prevalence is warranted.},

In this paper, we present a new architecture to perform MR image brain segmentation (MRI) into a number of classes based on type of tissue. Recent work has shown that convolutional neural networks (DenseNet) can be substantially more accurate with less number of parameters if each layer in the network is connected with every other layer in a feed forward fashion. We embrace this idea and generate new architecture that can assign each pixel/voxel in an MR image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided by the IBSR 2(Internet Brain Segmentation Repository), which consists of 18 manually segmented MR images of the brain. To our knowledge, our approach is the first to use DenseNet to perform anatomical segmentation of the whole brain."

abstract="Medical imaging registration is a critical step in a wide spectrum of medical applications from diagnosis to therapy and has been an extensively studied research field. Prior to the popularity of deep learningDeep learning, image registrationImage registration was commonly performed by optimizing an image matching metric as a cost function in search for the optimal registration. However, the optimization task is known to be challenging due to (1) the non-convex nature of the matching metric over the registration parameter space and (2) the lack of effective approaches for robust optimization. With the latest advance in deep learningDeep learning and artificial intelligence, the field of medical image registrationImage registration had a major paradigm shift, whereby learning-based image registrationImage registration methods are developed to employ deep neural networks to analyze images in order to estimate plausible registrations. Among the latest advances in learning-based registration methods, agent-based methods have been shown to be effective in both 3-D/3-D and 2-D/3-D registrations with significant robustness advantage over conventional optimization-based methods. In this chapter, we give an overview of agent-based methods for medical image registrationImage registration and its two applications on rigid-body 3-D/3-D and 2-D/3-D registrations.",

Although research originally generally focused upon decision-makers, the perspective of those targeted by automated or augmented decisions (whom we call “second parties”) and parties who observe the effects of such decisions (whom we call “third parties”) is now growing in importance and attention. We review the expanding literature investigating reactions to automated and augmented decision-making by second and third parties. Specifically, we explore attitude (e.g., evaluations of trustworthiness), perception (e.g., fairness perceptions), and behavior (e.g., reverse engineering of automated decision processes) outcomes of second and third parties. Additionally, we explore how characteristics of the a) decision-making process, b) system, c) second and third party, d) task, and e) outputs and outcomes moderate these effects, and provide recommendation for future research. Our review summarizes the state of the literature in these domains, concluding a) that reactions to automated decisions differ across situations in which there is remaining human decision control (i.e., augmentation contexts), b) that system design choices (e.g., transparency) are important but underresearched, and c) that the generalizability of findings might suffer from excessive reliance on specific research methodologies (e.g., vignette studies).}

The study also looked into users' liking of chatbots' responses to the users' utterance of profanity and offensive words. Using a national survey (N = 645), the study found that users' idealism orientation was a significant factor in explaining use of such offensive language. In addition, users with high idealism revealed liking of chatbots' active intervention, whereas those with high relativism displayed liking of chatbots' reactive responses. Moreover, users’ perceived humanlikeness of chatbot increased their likelihood of using offensive words targeting dislikable acquaintances, racial/ethnic groups, and political parties. These findings are expected to fill the gap between the current use of AI chatbots and the lack of empirical studies examining language use.}

abstract = {Computer systems cannot improve organizational performance if they aren't used. Unfortunately, resistance to end-user systems by managers and professionals is a widespread problem. To better predict, explain, and increase user acceptance, we need to better understand why people accept or reject computers. This research addresses the ability to predict peoples' computer acceptance from a measure of their intentions, and the ability to explain their intentions in terms of their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and related variables. In a longitudinal study of 107 users, intentions to use a specific system, measured after a one-hour introduction to the system, were correlated 0.35 with system use 14 weeks later. The intention-usage correlation was 0.63 at the end of this time period. Perceived usefulness strongly influenced peoples' intentions, explaining more than half of the variance in intentions at the end of 14 weeks. Perceived ease of use had a small but significant effect on intentions as well, although this effect subsided over time. Attitudes only partially mediated the effects of these beliefs on intentions. Subjective norms had no effect on intentions. These results suggest the possibility of simple but powerful models of the determinants of user acceptance, with practical value for evaluating systems and guiding managerial interventions aimed at reducing the problem of underutilized computer technology.},

 abstract = {Information technology (IT) acceptance research has yielded many competing models, each with different sets of acceptance determinants. In this paper, we (1) review user acceptance literature and discuss eight prominent models, (2) empirically compare the eight models and their extensions, (3) formulate a unified model that integrates elements across the eight models, and (4) empirically validate the unified model. The eight models reviewed are the theory of reasoned action, the technology acceptance model, the motivational model, the theory of planned behavior, a model combining the technology acceptance model and the theory of planned behavior, the model of PC utilization, the innovation diffusion theory, and the social cognitive theory. Using data from four organizations over a six-month period with three points of measurement, the eight models explained between 17 percent and 53 percent of the variance in user intentions to use information technology. Next, a unified model, called the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), was formulated, with four core determinants of intention and usage, and up to four moderators of key relationships. UTAUT was then tested using the original data and found to outperform the eight individual models (adjusted R of 69 percent). UTAUT was then confirmed with data from two new organizations with similar results (adjusted R of 70 percent). UTAUT thus provides a useful tool for managers needing to assess the likelihood of success for new technology introductions and helps them understand the drivers of acceptance in order to proactively design interventions (including training, marketing, etc.) targeted at populations of users that may be less inclined to adopt and use new systems. The paper also makes several recommendations for future research including developing a deeper understanding of the dynamic influences studied here, refining measurement of the core constructs used in UTAUT, and understanding the organizational outcomes associated with new technology use.},

abstract = {Research dealing with various aspects of the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1985, Ajzen, 1987) is reviewed, and some unresolved issues are discussed. In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.}

Since the seventies, IS research has contributed to a better understanding of this process and its outcomes. The early efforts concentrated on the identification of factors that facilitated IS use. This produced a long list of items that proved to be of little practical value. It became obvious that, for practical reasons, the factors had to be grouped into a model in a way that would facilitate analysis of IS use. In 1985, Fred Davis suggested the technology acceptance model (TAM). It examines the mediating role of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in their relation between systems characteristics (external variables) and the probability of system use (an indicator of system success). More recently, Davis proposed a new version of his model: TAM2. It includes subjective norms, and was tested with longitudinal research designs. Overall the two explain about 40\% of system’s use. Analysis of empirical research using TAM shows that results are not totally consistent or clear. This suggests that significant factors are not included in the models. We conclude that TAM is a useful model, but has to be integrated into a broader one which would include variables related to both human and social change processes, and to the adoption of the innovation model.}

However, as noted by several IS researchers, TAM is incomplete in one important respect: it doesn't account for social influence in the adoption and utilization of new information systems. Davis (1986) and Davis et al. (1989) noted that it is important to account for subjective norm (SN), the construct denoting social influence. However, they observed that the conceptualization of SN based on TRA (Theory of Reasoned Action) has theoretical and psychometric problems. Specifically, they observed that it is difficult to distinguish if usage behavior is caused by the influence of referents on one's intent or by one's own attitude. They suggested that this problem may be circumvented by using an alternative theoretical basis for conceptualizing SN, specifically in terms of Kelman's (1958, 1961) processes of social influence (compliance, identification and internalization). Within the context of organizational enterprisewide implementation and adoption of collaboration and communication technologies, this study establishes theoretical and empirical bases for the above conceptualization originally suggested by Davis and his colleagues. The construct of social influence is operationalized in terms of Kelman's processes of internalization, identification and compliance. Analyses of field study data provide evidence of the reliability and validity of the proposed constructs, factor structures and measures. The findings enable future researchers to account for social influence in further investigating TAM.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/HICSS.1999.772658},  ISSN={},  month={Jan},}

abstract = {ABSTRACT Mobile payments (MPs) are predicted to be one of the future's most successful mobile services but have achieved limited acceptance in developed countries to date. PCs are still the preferred technology for online shopping in the United Kingdom but the continued growth of mobile commerce (MC) is highly correlated with the success of remote MPs (RMPs). Currently MP research has largely ignored the variations between different MP solutions, and existing MP adoption studies have predominantly utilized Davis’ (1989) Technology Acceptance Model, which has been criticized for having a deterministic approach without much consideration for users’ individual characteristics. Therefore, this study applied the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), extended with more consumer-related constructs, to explore the factors affecting nonusers’ intentions to adopt RMP in the United Kingdom. Quantitative data were collected (n = 268) and structural equation modeling was undertaken. The findings revealed that performance expectancy, social influence, innovativeness, and perceived risk significantly influenced nonusers’ intentions to adopt RMP, whereas effort expectancy did not. Inclusion of MP knowledge as a moderating variable revealed that there was a significant difference in the effect of trust on behavioral intention for those who knew about MP than for those who did not. These findings have important theoretical and practical implications, particularly for the development and marketing of RMP, which will support the long-term success of MC.},

The proposed model, which combines the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) and technology acceptance model (TAM), was tested via structural equation modeling (SEM) by using data collected from 412 restaurant customers. The study results indicated that the proposed model provides approximately 20\% greater explanatory power and predictive accuracy than the original UTAUT model and demonstrates strong evidence of the effects of risk, security, and trust on customers' intentions to use NFC-based MP technology in restaurant settings. In addition, considering the total effect, attitude, security, and risk have the most substantial impact on customers’ behavioral intentions. The study results further demonstrate that risk, security, and trust are also important determinants, with direct and indirect impacts, of other critical constructs (i.e., effort expectancy, hedonic and utilitarian performance expectancy, attitude, and intention). The empirical findings provide valuable theoretical contributions for researchers and practical implications for restaurant operators and technology vendors by explaining the reasons as to why the NFC-based MP is not popular in North American restaurants.}

Structural equation modeling is used to construct a predictive model of attitudes toward the mobile wallet. Individuals’ responses to questions about attitude and intention to adopt/use a mobile wallet were collected and analyzed with various factors modified from UTAUT. While the model confirms the classical role of technology acceptance factors (i.e., perceived usefulness and ease of use are key antecedents to users’ attitude), the results also show that users’ attitudes and intentions are influenced by perceived security and trust. In the extended model, the moderating effects of demographics on the relations among the variables were found to be significant. The proposed model brings together extant research on mobile payment and provides an important cluster of antecedents to eventual technology acceptance via constructs of behavioral intention to use and actual system usage.}

We also examined how these trust beliefs might interact with both positive and negative valence factors and affect a customer's adoption of mobile payment services.

This comparative study determines which models best explain consumer acceptance of AI-based intelligent products and which factors have the greatest impact in terms of purchase intention. We assessed the utility of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), and the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM) using data collected from a survey sample of 378 respondents, modeling user acceptance in terms of behavioral intention to use AI-based intelligent products. In addition, we employed decomposition analysis to compare each factor included in these models in terms of influence on purchase intention. We found that the VAM performed best in modeling user acceptance. Among the various factors, enjoyment was found to influence user purchase intention the most, followed by subjective norms. The findings of this study confirm that acceptance of highly innovative products with minimal practical value, such as AI-based intelligent products, is more influenced by interest in technology than in utilitarian aspects.}

abstract="Background: Poor quality primary health care is a major issue in China, particularly in blindness prevention. Artificial intelligence (AI) could provide early screening and accurate auxiliary diagnosis to improve primary care services and reduce unnecessary referrals, but the application of AI in medical settings is still an emerging field. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the general public's acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices, with reference to those already used in China, and the interrelated influencing factors that shape people's intention to use these devices. Methods: We proposed a model of ophthalmic AI acceptance based on technology acceptance theories and variables from other health care--related studies. The model was verified via a 32-item questionnaire with 7-point Likert scales completed by 474 respondents (nationally random sampled). Structural equation modeling was used to evaluate item and construct reliability and validity via a confirmatory factor analysis, and the model's path effects, significance, goodness of fit, and mediation and moderation effects were analyzed. Results: Standardized factor loadings of items were between 0.583 and 0.876. Composite reliability of 9 constructs ranged from 0.673 to 0.841. The discriminant validity of all constructs met the Fornell and Larcker criteria. Model fit indicators such as standardized root mean square residual (0.057), comparative fit index (0.915), and root mean squared error of approximation (0.049) demonstrated good fit. Intention to use (R2=0.515) is significantly affected by subjective norms (beta=.408; P<.001), perceived usefulness (beta=.336; P=.03), and resistance bias (beta=--.237; P=.02). Subjective norms and perceived behavior control had an indirect impact on intention to use through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Eye health consciousness had an indirect positive effect on intention to use through perceived usefulness. Trust had a significant moderation effect (beta=--.095; P=.049) on the effect path of perceived usefulness to intention to use. Conclusions: The item, construct, and model indicators indicate reliable interpretation power and help explain the levels of public acceptance of ophthalmic AI devices in China. The influence of subjective norms can be linked to Confucian culture, collectivism, authoritarianism, and conformity mentality in China. Overall, the use of AI in diagnostics and clinical laboratory analysis is underdeveloped, and the Chinese public are generally mistrustful of medical staff and the Chinese medical system. Stakeholders such as doctors and AI suppliers should therefore avoid making misleading or over-exaggerated claims in the promotion of AI health care products. ",

abstract = {This paper reports on a systematic literature review aimed at mapping current practices regarding the use of participatory design in the development of healthcare systems and identifying a future research roadmap. Our analysis of 52 papers revealed eight participatory design principles. These principles demand that designers pay attention to the actors' habits and perspectives; their relationship; their mastery of techniques, language and technology; and the implementation process and context. The review also identifies at least four future research avenues that suggest that researchers pay more attention to the variety of end users involved in the participatory design process, develop a common framework that can be used in various contexts, focus on a broader context (beyond hospital and home) in which the system is developed and used and examine what methods fit best with certain development contexts.},

Today's healthcare system is undergoing perceptible changes as the system is facing a paradigm shift due to demographic changes, technological developments, increasing complexity, organisational changes, and demands on user involvement and participation. The aim of this workshop is to reflect on the challenges and dilemmas which are emerging when participatory design is used in Healthcare, because the epistemological, cultural, methodological assumptions of participatory design collide with the traditionally well-established science tradition, language, culture and biomedical approach in health science.This workshop will be an opportunity to share our experiences in using participatory design in healthcare and research, or experiences in applying participatory design activities across different healthcare systems, particularly addressing dilemmas on knowledge, power and participation.},

abstract="Background: For the majority of preterm infants, the last weeks of hospital admission mainly concerns tube feeding and establishment of breastfeeding. Neonatal home care (NH) was developed to allow infants to remain at home for tube feeding and establishment of breastfeeding with regular home visits from neonatal nurses. For hospitals covering large regions, home visits may be challenging, time consuming, and expensive and alternative approaches must be explored. Objective: To identify parental needs when wanting to provide neonatal home care supported by telemedicine. Methods: The study used participatory design and qualitative methods. Data were collected from observational studies, individual interviews, and focus group interviews. Two neonatal units participated. One unit was experienced in providing neonatal home care with home visits, and the other planned to offer neonatal home care with telemedicine support. A total of 9 parents with preterm infants assigned to a neonatal home care program and 10 parents with preterm infants admitted to a neonatal unit participated in individual interviews and focus group interviews, respectively. Results: Three overall themes were identified: being a family, parent self-efficacy, and nurse-provided security. Parents expressed desire for the following: (1) a telemedicine device to serve as a ``bell cord'' to the neonatal unit, giving 24-hour access to nurses, (2) video-conferencing to provide security at home, (3) timely written email communication with the neonatal unit, and (4) an online knowledge base on preterm infant care, breastfeeding, and nutrition. Conclusions: Our findings highlight the importance of neonatal home care. NH provides parents with a feeling of being a family, supports their self-efficacy, and gives them a feeling of security when combined with nursing guidance. Parents did not request hands-on support for infant care, but instead expressed a need for communication and guidance, which could be met using telemedicine. ",

abstract="Background: Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in health care have garnered much attention in recent years, but the implementation issues posed by AI have not been substantially addressed. Objective: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Results: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years.

The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was adapted and incorporated with attitude and hedonic performance expectancy. Two steps of structural equation modeling were used to validate the measurement model and test the hypothesized relationships. Findings The study found that utilitarian and hedonic performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions are critical determinants of US consumers' intentions to use mobile shopping services. Effort expectancy is a driving factor affecting utilitarian and hedonic performance expectancy of mobile shopping services. Further, the study found that the hedonic or entertainment aspect of mobile shopping services is the most critical driver of US consumers' intentions to use mobile shopping services.

A platform exhibits network effects if, the more that people use it, the more valuable it becomes to each user. Theorizing about the value perceived by users of a platform that exhibits network effects has traditionally focused on direct and indirect network effects. In this paper, we theorize about a new category of network effects—data network effects—that has emerged from advances in artificial intelligence and the growing availability of data. A platform exhibits data network effects if, the more that the platform learns from the data it collects on users, the more valuable the platform becomes to each user. We argue that there is a positive direct relationship between the artificial intelligence capability of a platform and the value perceived in the platform by its users—a relationship that is moderated by platform legitimation, data stewardship, and user-centric design. }

Partial least squares (PLS) structural equational modeling was employed to assess the relationship between latent constructs. Results: Effort expectancy ($\beta$ = 0.201, p < 0.05) and social influence ($\beta$ = 0.574, p < 0.05) were positively associated with initial trust, while no association was found between performance expectancy and initial trust (p > 0.05). Only social influence ($\beta$ = 0.527, p < 0.05) was positively related to the behavioral intention. Conclusions: This study highlights positive behavioral intentions in using an AI-based diagnosis support system among prospective Vietnamese physicians, as well as the effect of social influence on this choice. The development of AI-based competent curricula should be considered when reforming medical education in Vietnam.},

abstract = {Purpose
The purpose of this study was to assess the perception, knowledge, wishes and expectations of a sample of French radiologists towards the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiology.
Material and method
A general data protection regulation-compliant electronic survey was sent by e-mail to the 617 radiologists registered in the French departments of Nord and Pas-de-Calais (93 radiology residents and 524 senior radiologists), from both public and private institutions. The survey included 42 questions focusing on AI in radiology, and data were collected between January 16th and January 31st, 2019. The answers were analyzed together by a senior radiologist and a radiology resident.
Results
A total of 70 radiology residents and 200 senior radiologists participated to the survey, which corresponded to a response rate of 43.8\% (270/617). One hundred ninety-eight radiologists (198/270; 73.3\%) estimated they had received insufficient previous information on AI. Two hundred and fifty-five respondents (255/270; 94.4\%) would consider attending a generic continuous medical education in this field and 187 (187/270; 69.3\%) a technically advanced training on AI. Two hundred and fourteen respondents (214/270; 79.3\%) thought that AI will have a positive impact on their future practice. The highest expectations were the lowering of imaging-related medical errors (219/270; 81\%), followed by the lowering of the interpretation time of each examination (201/270; 74.4\%) and the increase in the time spent with patients (141/270; 52.2\%).
Conclusion
While respondents had the feeling of receiving insufficient previous information on AI, they are willing to improve their knowledge and technical skills on this field. They share an optimistic view and think that AI will have a positive impact on their future practice. A lower risk of imaging-related medical errors and an increase in the time spent with patients are among their main expectations.}

Hence, this study aims to analyse how the integration of AI in shopping can lead to an improved AI-enabled customer experience. We propose a theoretical model drawing on the trust-commitment theory and service quality model. An online survey was distributed to customers who have used an AI- enabled service offered by a beauty brand. A total of 434 responses were analysed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. The findings indicate the significant role of trust and perceived sacrifice as factors mediating the effects of perceived convenience, personalisation and AI-enabled service quality. The findings also reveal the significant effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. This study contributes to the existing literature by revealing the mediating effects of trust and perceived sacrifice and the direct effect of relationship commitment on AI-enabled customer experience. In addition, the study has practical implications for retailers deploying AI in services offered to their customers.}

abstract={Structural equation modeling (SEM) represents a theory-driven data analytical approach for the evaluation of a priori specified hypotheses about causal relations among measured and/or latent variables. Such hypotheses may be expressed in a variety of forms, with the most common being measured variable path analysis models, confirmatory factor analysis models, and latent variable path analysis models. For analyzing models of these as well as more complex types, SEM is not viewed as a mere statistical technique but rather as an analytical process involving model conceptualization, parameter identification and estimation, data-model fit assessment, and potential model re-specification. Ultimately, this process allows for the assessment of fit between (typically) correlational data, obtained from experimental or non-experimental research, and one or more competing causal theories specified a priori; most common SEM applications are not designed for exploratory purposes. Software packages such as AMOS, EQS, lavaan, LISREL, Mx, and Mplus are utilized to complete the computational aspects of the overall SEM process. For contemporary treatments of SEM the authors recommend texts by Byrne, Kline, and Loehlin and Beaujean, or, for more advanced readers, books by Bollen, Hancock and Mueller, Hoyle, and Kaplan. This chapter presents specific desiderata for applied studies that utilize SEM. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {With the spread of new educational technology such as the interactive whiteboard (IWB) teachers, as potential users, need to adapt their teaching in order to successfully utilize it. Despite considerable efforts in motivating teachers to use new educational technology, there are mixed feelings about whether to accept and use this technology in the classroom or not. In this study we propose to extend the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with a new moderator variable user type in order to investigate differences in the UTAUT determinants between pre- and post-adopters of IWBs. The results of the study showed significant differences in causal effect sizes between pre- and post-adopters for several paths of the proposed research model. When compared to post-adopters, we can see that for pre-adopters: 1) social influence has a bigger impact on behavioral intentions, 2) performance expectancy more strongly affects attitudes toward using IWBs, and 3) there is a difference in attitudes towards using IWB on users' potential use of IWBs. For post-adopters: 4) the facilitating conditions have a bigger impact on the actual use of IWBs, and 5) behavioral intention is a stronger predictor of the actual use of IWBs when compared with pre-adopters.}

For example, when considering structural equation modelling (SEM), selecting between covariance-based (CB-SEM) and variance-based partial least squares (PLS-SEM) can be challenging. This paper applies the same theoretical measurement and structural models and dataset to conduct a direct comparison. The findings reveal that when using CB-SEM, many indicators are removed to achieve acceptable goodness-of-fit, when compared to PLS-SEM. Also, composite reliability and convergent validity were typically higher using PLS-SEM, but other metrics such as discriminant validity and beta coefficients are comparable. Finally, when comparing variance explained in the dependent variable indicators, PLS-SEM was substantially better than CB-SEM. Updated guidelines assist researchers in determining whether CB-SEM or PLS-SEM is the most appropriate method to use. }

abstract = {Due to its advantages such as ubiquity and immediacy, mobile banking has attracted traditional banks’ interests. However, a survey report showed that user adoption of mobile banking was much lower than that of other mobile services. The extant research focuses on explaining user adoption from technology perceptions such as perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, interactivity, and relative advantage. However, users’ adoption is determined not only by their perception of the technology but also by the task technology fit. In other words, even though a technology may be perceived as being advanced, if it does not fit users’ task requirements, they may not adopt it. By integrating the task technology fit (TTF) model and the unified theory of acceptance and usage of technology (UTAUT), this research proposes a mobile banking user adoption model. We found that performance expectancy, task technology fit, social influence, and facilitating conditions have significant effects on user adoption. In addition, we also found a significant effect of task technology fit on performance expectancy.}

The purpose of this study is to describe development of a self-efficacy instrument to measure confidence in obtaining a mammogram. Bandura's model guided item development. Construct validity was measured using confirmatory factor analysis and logistic regression. Cronbach alpha was used to test internal consistency reliability. A Cronbach alpha coefficient of .87 was obtained. The mammography self-efficacy scale evidenced content and construct validity. © Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Res Nurs Health 28:329–336, 2005},

ABSTRACT={Scale development and validation are critical to much of the work in the health, social, and behavioral sciences. However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.}

abstract={Discriminant validity assessment has become a generally accepted prerequisite for analyzing relationships between latent variables. For variance-based structural equation modeling, such as partial least squares, the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the examination of cross-loadings are the dominant approaches for evaluating discriminant validity. By means of a simulation study, we show that these approaches do not reliably detect the lack of discriminant validity in common research situations. We therefore propose an alternative approach, based on the multitrait-multimethod matrix, to assess discriminant validity: the heterotrait-monotrait ratio of correlations. We demonstrate its superior performance by means of a Monte Carlo simulation study, in which we compare the new approach to the Fornell-Larcker criterion and the assessment of (partial) cross-loadings. Finally, we provide guidelines on how to handle discriminant validity issues in variance-based structural equation modeling.},

Through three experimental studies with Chinese and American participants, we tested how the design of medical AI varies between in- and out-groups. Participants adopted the role of a medical AI designer and decided how to develop medical AI for in- or out-groups based on their experimental condition. Studies 1 (pre-registered: N = 191) revealed that Chinese participants were less likely to adopt human doctors' assistance in medical AI system when targeting patients from US (i.e., out-groups) than for patients from China (i.e., in-groups). Study 2 (N = 190) revealed that US participants were less likely to adopt human doctors' assistance in medical AI system when targeting patients from China (i.e., out-groups) than for patients from US (i.e., in-groups). Study 3 revealed that Chinese medical students (N = 160) selected a smaller training database for AI when diagnosing diabetic retinopathy among US patients (i.e., out-groups) than for Chinese patients (i.e., in-groups), and this effect was stronger among medical students from higher (vs. lower) socioeconomic backgrounds. This AI design inequity was mediated by individuals’ underestimation of out-group heterogeneity. Overall, our evidence suggests that out-group stereotype shapes the design of medical AI, unwittingly undermining healthcare quality. The current findings underline the need for more robust data on medical AI development and intervention research addressing healthcare inequity.}

When patients finish medical treatment in offline hospitals, they can find the doctor for online follow-up service at the post-diagnosis step. To understand which factors can affect patients’ decisions on adopting an online follow-up service, this paper drew on the Elaboration Likelihood Model as the theoretical base to study patients’ decision process. We regarded the technical quality and interpersonal quality of doctors’ medical service as central cues and considered electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) as a peripheral cue. By analyzing the data from a popular online health community in China, the results show that the technical quality, interpersonal quality, and eWOM of doctors’ medical services positively impacted patients’ online follow-up intention. Moreover, we also found that high-privacy disease and private doctor service significantly moderate the relationship between technical quality or eWOM of doctors’ medical services and patients’ online follow-up intention. Our study sheds some light on profoundly understanding the decision process of patients in using online follow-up services and contributes to the research of online healthcare services.}

This study aimed to examine the roles of trust and three AI-specific characteristics (i.e., personalization, loss of privacy, anthropomorphism) in public acceptance of smart healthcare services based on an extended Technology Acceptance Model. The model's validity was confirmed using a partial least squares structural equation modeling technique based on data collected from 769 survey samples. Multigroup analyses were conducted to determine whether the path coefficients differed by gender, age, and usage experience. The results showed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and the three AI-specific characteristics were important determinants of public acceptance of smart healthcare services, whose roles were fully or partially mediated by trust. Trust, perceived usefulness, and personalization directly determined behavioral intention to use smart healthcare services. The relationships among antecedent factors and behavioral intention to use smart healthcare services were also moderated by gender, age, and usage experience. The study demonstrated the critical roles of personalization, loss of privacy, and anthropomorphism in shaping public trust and acceptance of smart healthcare services. The results offer important theoretical and practical implications for the design and implementation of such services.}

We found that functional and communicative health literacy and trust in doctor have linear and curvilinear relationships with anxiety when consulting a doctor. Health numeracy had no effect. Anxiety when consulting a doctor was associated with a lower number of physician consultations and lower SWB. We observed direct linear effects of health literacy, health numeracy, and trust in doctor on frequency of physician consultations and SWB, as well as some curvilinear effects. We found a negative relationship between health numeracy and SWB. We discuss implications of these findings for health and public policy.},

The present study thus provides a systematic review of the psychometric properties of these scales. This review included articles that aimed at either developing an SNS engagement scale or providing a systematic test of the psychometric properties of the scale. We conducted keyword-based searches of several broad multidisciplinary databases, along with reference list searches and article citation searches. These search strategies yielded a total of 14 reports, revealing validation evidence for 12 SNS engagement scales among 13,861 participants from 11 countries. There was mixed evidence for the various types of validity tests, with some scales having been validated more rigorously with multiple studies and samples while others having not yet been systematically validated. Sampling and acquiescence biases were also present for some scales. The present review provides recommendations for researchers intending to study SNS engagement. Although the literature search was multi-faceted, it may conceivably have missed studies that provided less rigorous validity evidence. Overall, this study contributes to evaluating and strengthening the methodological foundations of SNS research.}

abstract="Background: An artificial intelligence (AI)--assisted contouring system benefits radiation oncologists by saving time and improving treatment accuracy. Yet, there is much hope and fear surrounding such technologies, and this fear can manifest as resistance from health care professionals, which can lead to the failure of AI projects. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop and test a model for investigating the factors that drive radiation oncologists' acceptance of AI contouring technology in a Chinese context. Methods: A model of AI-assisted contouring technology acceptance was developed based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model by adding the variables of perceived risk and resistance that were proposed in this study. The model included 8 constructs with 29 questionnaire items. A total of 307 respondents completed the questionnaires. Structural equation modeling was conducted to evaluate the model's path effects, significance, and fitness. Results: The overall fitness indices for the model were evaluated and showed that the model was a good fit to the data. Behavioral intention was significantly affected by performance expectancy ($\beta$=.155; P=.01), social influence ($\beta$=.365; P<.001), and facilitating conditions ($\beta$=.459; P<.001). Effort expectancy ($\beta$=.055; P=.45), perceived risk ($\beta$=−.048; P=.35), and resistance bias ($\beta$=−.020; P=.63) did not significantly affect behavioral intention. Conclusions: The physicians' overall perceptions of an AI-assisted technology for radiation contouring were high. Technology resistance among Chinese radiation oncologists was low and not related to behavioral intention. Not all of the factors in the Venkatesh UTAUT model applied to AI technology adoption among physicians in a Chinese context. ",

It also predicts that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and country) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach Data from a web survey of 765 North American, British and Portuguese potential users of robo-advisor services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses. Findings Consumers' attitudes toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found to be the key determinants of adoption. The influences of perceived usefulness and attitude are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn, subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for customers from Anglo-Saxon countries. Practical implications Banks and other firms in the finance industry should design robo-advisors to be used by a wide spectrum of consumers. Marketing tactics applied should consider the customer's level of familiarity with robots. Originality/value This research identifies the key drivers of robo-advisor adoption and the moderating effect of personal and sociodemographic variables.

This research also investigated cultural domination on citizens' behavioural perception. The data for this study was collected among citizens from three countries: USA, Canada, and Bangladesh. The findings suggest that the UTAUT model could partially shape technology artefact behaviour and the extended UTAUT must consider specific determinants relevant to cognitive, affective, and conative or behavioural aspects of citizens. The model helps policy-makers to develop mobile healthcare service system that will be better accepted. The finding also suggests that this mobile service system should reflect a country's cultural traits.

The empirical results showed that performance expectations, effort expectations, social influence, and facilitating conditions positively affected their behavioral intention to use health information technology, whereas perceived risk had the opposite effect. This study found that the positive effects of social influence and effort expectations on the behavioral intention to use health information technology increased with improvement in the perceived level of city smartness and technical information transparency. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical implications.}

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as powerful tools to transform medical care. Although machine learning classifiers (MLCs) have already demonstrated strong performance in image-based diagnoses, analysis of diverse and massive electronic health record (EHR) data remains challenging. Here, we show that MLCs can query EHRs in a manner similar to the hypothetico-deductive reasoning used by physicians and unearth associations that previous statistical methods have not found. Our model applies an automated natural language processing system using deep learning techniques to extract clinically relevant information from EHRs. In total, 101.6 million data points from 1,362,559 pediatric patient visits presenting to a major referral center were analyzed to train and validate the framework. Our model demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy across multiple organ systems and is comparable to experienced pediatricians in diagnosing common childhood diseases. Our study provides a proof of concept for implementing an AI-based system as a means to aid physicians in tackling large amounts of data, augmenting diagnostic evaluations, and to provide clinical decision support in cases of diagnostic uncertainty or complexity. Although this impact may be most evident in areas where healthcare providers are in relative shortage, the benefits of such an AI system are likely to be universal.},

abstract = {Summary
Background
Medical artificial intelligence (AI) has entered the clinical implementation phase, although real-world performance of deep-learning systems (DLSs) for screening fundus disease remains unsatisfactory. Our study aimed to train a clinically applicable DLS for fundus diseases using data derived from the real world, and externally test the model using fundus photographs collected prospectively from the settings in which the model would most likely be adopted.
Methods
In this national real-world evidence study, we trained a DLS, the Comprehensive AI Retinal Expert (CARE) system, to identify the 14 most common retinal abnormalities using 207 228 colour fundus photographs derived from 16 clinical settings with different disease distributions. CARE was internally validated using 21 867 photographs and externally tested using 18 136 photographs prospectively collected from 35 real-world settings across China where CARE might be adopted, including eight tertiary hospitals, six community hospitals, and 21 physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was further compared with that of 16 ophthalmologists and tested using datasets with non-Chinese ethnicities and previously unused camera types. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04213430, and is currently closed.
Findings
The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in the internal validation set was 0·955 (SD 0·046). AUC values in the external test set were 0·965 (0·035) in tertiary hospitals, 0·983 (0·031) in community hospitals, and 0·953 (0·042) in physical examination centres. The performance of CARE was similar to that of ophthalmologists. Large variations in sensitivity were observed among the ophthalmologists in different regions and with varying experience. The system retained strong identification performance when tested using the non-Chinese dataset (AUC 0·960, 95% CI 0·957–0·964 in referable diabetic retinopathy).
Interpretation
Our DLS (CARE) showed satisfactory performance for screening multiple retinal abnormalities in real-world settings using prospectively collected fundus photographs, and so could allow the system to be implemented and adopted for clinical care.
Funding
This study was funded by the National Key R&D Programme of China, the Science and Technology Planning Projects of Guangdong Province, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.

ABSTRACT = {Precision medical technologies have received a great deal of attention, but promoting such technologies remains a problem for enterprises and medical institutions. Adopting the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model and the health belief model (HBM), this study investigated the key factors affecting users&rsquo; willingness to adopt precision medicine (PM) in terms of technical factors and external stimuli. Based on 415 questionnaires, performance expectancy, price value, social influence, and perceived threat of disease were found to significantly increase users willingness to adopt PM; meanwhile, privacy risks had the opposite effect. Knowledge about PM was found to strengthen the positive effect of performance expectancy, price value, social influence, and perceived threat of disease on willingness to adopt PM and weaken the negative effect of privacy risk. This study demonstrates the successful application of UTAUT to the medical field while also providing guidance for the promotion of PM.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) service failures are inevitable in hospitality companies; thus, how AI service recovery retains customers is an issue that cannot be ignored. This article focuses on AI service recovery, abandoning the traditional “intelligence quotient” thinking and exploring the recovery effect of empathy response from the perspective of emotional intelligence. Using four experimental scenarios, the results indicate that, in service recovery, a high-empathy AI response can increase customers’ continuous usage intention, and psychological distance and trust are sequential mediators in this process. Compared with mono-sensory stimulus interactions (text only), a high-empathy response that adopts multisensory stimulus interactions (text and voice) could strengthen the recovery effect of empathy responses. This paper extends the field of AI service research from a focus on time and phase to the continuing use of AI after service failure. It also moves beyond the traditional intelligence quotient improvement thinking and reveals the importance of using AI emotional intelligence to activate customer emotional response in AI service recovery. Finally, it provides a useful tool for resolving AI service failure problems autonomously in the service process, which is of great value to research and development and hospitality operators in the promotion and application of AI services.}

Despite substantial investment, they have failed to reach widespread acceptance. Limited adoption can be linked to little involvement of prospective users in the design process and overreliance on deficit models of ageing that portray people in decline. The paper proposes a structured methodology to collect user requirements based on the Integrated Behavioural Model. The methodology was applied in an interview study investigating behavioural intentions of preferred activities in a sample of 18 older users. Results have been elaborated as desires for actions in a model which puts the person (described in terms of attitudes, perceived norms and personal agency) to the forefront of the designer's attention. The model is contrasted with related work on technology adoption and used to define trajectories for active ageing technology as design for pleasurable and resourceful ageing.}

This research concerns wearable sensing technology to support posture monitoring for the prevention of occupational low back pain and, more specifically, how smart garments can help nurses avoid prolonged strenuous postures at work. We introduce BackUp, a system comprising of a smart shirt connected to a smartphone application that provides feedback and advice on low back posture, and we describe its design and implementation. We report on a series of studies that contributed to its development: an anthropometric study (N = 60) to decide on the placement of sensors on the lower spine; a brief field study aimed at evaluating user experience and attitudes towards the shirt (N = 17), and a second field study intended to assess its effectiveness in helping nurses avoid prolonged strenuous postures at work (N = 13). These studies demonstrate how smart clothing can support posture feedback in real life conditions. While the results from the field studies are encouraging regarding the potential of this technology, further research is needed to establish the durability of the behaviour modification achieved through smart garments.}

Computer-based personal assistance can help to behave healthy by persuading and guiding older adults. For effective persuasion, the assistant should express social behaviors (e.g., turn taking, emotional expressions) to be trustworthy and show empathy. From the motivational interviewing method and synthetic assistants’ literature, we derived a set of social behaviors, and implemented a subset in a physical character, a virtual character and a text interface. The first behavior type concerns conversing with high-level dialogue (semantics, intentions), which could be implemented in all 3 assistants. The other behavior types could only be implemented in the characters: showing natural cues (e.g., gaze, posture), expressing emotions (e.g., compassionate face), and accommodating social conversations (e.g., turn taking). In an experiment, 24 older adults (45–65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a “one-week diabetics scenario”. They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters. However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better. Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface. Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character.}

Usability and ease of use increased over the six months but hedonic quality did not. Quantitative and qualitative measures of utility, user experience and effectiveness were compared for the iPad and applications. Applications scored better on utility but not usability. All users continued to use their iPads and apps for learning and leisure. A follow-up study was carried out to compare medical students who had stopped using their iPads after the initial study period. Pre-use measures showed no differences between the adopter and non-adopter cohorts, but measures during use were significantly worse on all measures for non-adopters. The main reasons for rejections were lack of training, prior predisposition not to adopt new technology, and lack of motivation. Differences between the cohorts were more marked for applications than for the iPad measures, suggesting that application functionality was the key influence on technology adoption.}

A potential way to meet this need is through interacting with pet-type robots such as the seal robot, PARO. There was a need to extend research on PARO's potential benefits beyond cognitively impaired and dependently living older adults. Because independently living, cognitively intact older adults may also have socio-emotional needs, the primary goal of this study was to investigate their attitudes, emotions, and engagement with PARO to identify its potential applicability to this demographic. Thirty older adults participated in an interaction period with PARO, and their attitudes and emotions toward PARO were assessed before and after using a multi-method approach. Video of the interaction was coded to determine the types and frequency of engagements participants initiated with PARO. Overall, there were no pre-post interaction differences on these measures. However, semi-structured interviews suggested that these older adults had positive attitudes towards PARO's attributes, thought it would be easy to use, and perceived potential uses for both themselves and others. Participants varied in their frequency of engagement with PARO. A novel finding is that this active engagement frequency uniquely predicted post-interaction period positive affect. This study advances understanding of healthy older adults’ attitudes, emotions, and engagement with PARO and of possible ways in which PARO could provide social and emotional support to healthy older adults. The results are informative for future research and design of pet-type robots.}

The main goal of our study was to compare different forms of embodiment of Voice User Interfaces (VUI) in terms of how much they distract a user from a cognitive task. We used a voice-only system without physical embodiment (voice-only), a physical embodied system without anthropomorphic features (physical embodied), and a social embodied VUI with social cues such as eye movements (social embodied). In addition, we explored the relationship between design features of the VUI and perceived distraction, social presence, and perceived calm. Twenty-four participants carried out four different cognitive tasks with the three different VUI and one round of cognitive tasks without any VUI present. The cognitive tasks were chosen from a serious game (BrainTagger Suit) and included measurements of cognitive speed, working memory, visual memory, and process inhibition. Overall, results indicated the voice-only VUI caused the least distraction, especially for cognitive speed, while slightly showing impairment for visual memory. Social embodied VUI appeared to cause the most distraction across the four cognitive tasks with physical embodied VUI falling in between. Surprisingly, social presence was perceived as highest for the voice-only system which at the same time received the lowest scores for perceived calm. The advantages and disadvantages of each VUI are discussed.}

To conceptualize mobile application usability, we analyzed Microsoft’s mobile usability guidelines and defined 10 constructs representing mobile application usability. Next, we conducted a pilot study followed by a quantitative assessment of the content validity of the scales. We then sequentially applied exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to two samples (n=404; n=501) consisting of German consumers using mobile social media applications on their smartphones. To evaluate the confirmatory factor model, we followed a step-by-step process assessing unidimensionality, discriminant validity and reliability. To assess the nomological validity of our instrument, we examined the impact of mobile application usability on two outcomes: continued intention to use and brand loyalty. The results confirmed that mobile application usability was a good predictor of both outcomes. The constructs and scales associated with mobile application usability validated in this paper can be used to guide future research in human–computer interaction and aid in the effective design of mobile applications.}

abstract="Enormous advances in the domain of statistical machine learning, the availability of large amounts of training data, and increasing computing power have made Artificial Intelligence (AI) very successful. For certain tasks, algorithms can even achieve performance beyond the human level. Unfortunately, the most powerful methods suffer from the fact that it is difficult to explain why a certain result was achieved on the one hand, and that they lack robustness on the other. Our most powerful machine learning models are very sensitive to even small changes. Perturbations in the input data can have a dramatic impact on the output and lead to entirely different results. This is of great importance in virtually all critical domains where we suffer from low data quality, i.e. we do not have the expected i.i.d. data. Therefore, the use of AI in domains that impact human life (agriculture, climate, health, ...) has led to an increased demand for trustworthy AI. Explainability is now even mandatory due to regulatory requirements in sensitive domains such as medicine, which requires traceability, transparency and interpretability capabilities. One possible step to make AI more robust is to combine statistical learning with knowledge representations. For certain tasks, it can be advantageous to use a human in the loop. A human expert can - sometimes, of course not always - bring experience, domain knowledge and conceptual understanding to the AI pipeline. Such approaches are not only a solution from a legal point of view, but in many application areas the ``why'' is often more important than a pure classification result. Consequently, both explainability and robustness can promote reliability and trust and ensure that humans remain in control, thus complementing human intelligence with artificial intelligence.",

ABSTRACT = {AI-assisted decision-making that impacts individuals raises critical questions about transparency and fairness in artificial intelligence (AI). Much research has highlighted the reciprocal relationships between the transparency/explanation and fairness in AI-assisted decision-making. Thus, considering their impact on user trust or perceived fairness simultaneously benefits responsible use of socio-technical AI systems, but currently receives little attention. In this paper, we investigate the effects of AI explanations and fairness on human-AI trust and perceived fairness, respectively, in specific AI-based decision-making scenarios. A user study simulating AI-assisted decision-making in two health insurance and medical treatment decision-making scenarios provided important insights. Due to the global pandemic and restrictions thereof, the user studies were conducted as online surveys. From the participant&rsquo;s trust perspective, fairness was found to affect user trust only under the condition of a low fairness level, with the low fairness level reducing user trust. However, adding explanations helped users increase their trust in AI-assisted decision-making. From the perspective of perceived fairness, our work found that low levels of introduced fairness decreased users&rsquo; perceptions of fairness, while high levels of introduced fairness increased users&rsquo; perceptions of fairness. The addition of explanations definitely increased the perception of fairness. Furthermore, we found that application scenarios influenced trust and perceptions of fairness. The results show that the use of AI explanations and fairness statements in AI applications is complex: we need to consider not only the type of explanations and the degree of fairness introduced, but also the scenarios in which AI-assisted decision-making is used.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the biomedical domain is gaining significant interest and holds considerable potential for the future of healthcare, particularly also in the context of in vitro diagnostics. The European In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR) explicitly includes software in its requirements. This poses major challenges for In Vitro Diagnostic devices (IVDs) that involve Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for data analysis and decision support. This can increase the difficulty of applying some of the most successful ML and Deep Learning (DL) methods to the biomedical domain, just by missing the required explanatory components from the manufacturers. In this context, trustworthy AI has to empower biomedical professionals to take responsibility for their decision-making, which clearly raises the need for explainable AI methods. Explainable AI, such as layer-wise relevance propagation, can help in highlighting the relevant parts of inputs to, and representations in, a neural network that caused a result and visualize these relevant parts. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, the concept of causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations produced by explainable AI methods. This paper describes both concepts and gives examples of how explainability and causability are essential in order to demonstrate scientific validity as well as analytical and clinical performance for future AI-based IVDs.}

abstract = {Background
One of the most important factors for the success of health information technology (IT) implementation is users’ acceptance and use of that technology. Thailand has implemented the national universal healthcare program and has been restructuring the country's health IT system to support it. However, there is no national data available regarding the acceptance and use of health IT in many healthcare facilities, including community health centers (CHCs). This study employed a modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) structural model, to understand factors that influence health IT adoption in community health centers in Thailand and to validate this extant IT adoption model in a developing country health care context.
Methods
An observational research design was employed to study CHCs’ IT adoption and use. A random sample of 1607 regionally stratified CHC's from a total of 9806 CHCs was selected. Data collection was conducted using a cross-sectional survey by means of self-administered questionnaire with an 82\% response rate. The research model was applied using the partial least squares (PLS) path modeling.
Results
The data showed that people who worked in CHCs exhibited a high degree of IT acceptance and use. The research model analyses suggest that IT acceptance is influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and voluntariness. Health IT use is predicted by previous IT experiences, intention to use the system, and facilitating conditions.
Conclusions
Health IT is pervasive and well adopted by CHCs in Thailand. The study results have implications for both health IT developmental efforts in Thailand and health informatics research. This study validated the UTAUT model in the field context of a developing country's healthcare system and demonstrated that the PLS path modeling works well in a field study and in exploratory research with a complex model.}

The study integrates the TOE (Technology--Organization--Environment) framework with the Information System Strategic Triangle (IS Triangle) and the HOT-fit (Human--Organization--Technology) model to provide a holistic evaluation of the determinants of Cloud Computing adoption in healthcare organisations. Of the five perspectives examined in this study, the Business perspective was found to be the most important followed by the Technology, Organisational and Environmental perspectives and finally the Human perspective. The findings of the study showed that the five most important factors influencing the adoption of Cloud Computing in this context are soft financial analysis, relative advantage, hard financial analysis, attitude toward change and pressure from partners in the business ecosystem. This study identifies the critical factors for both practitioners and academics that influence Cloud Computing adoption decision-making in Saudi healthcare.},

Physicians often need uptodate, reliable and with easy access information for clinical decisions evidence based medicine (EBM) databases can be a suitable approach to meet this need. The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, use and factors affecting the acceptance of EBM and its databases by Iranian medical residents using UTAUT model.
Method
The present research is an applied survey, the population of which consisted of 192 medical residents of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences (SBUMS) in Iran. A questionnaire was used for collecting data and SPSS software was used for data analysis.
Results
The results show that the total average score of assistants (range = 1–5), 2.99 and 2.73 scores were respectively obtained for the awareness and use of EBM databases. The study of factors affecting the acceptance using UTAUT showed that item "performance expectancy" with an average of 3.02 is the most important factor in the acceptance of EBM databases by medical residents and items "effort expectancy", "facilitating conditions" and "social influence" are in their next ranks with an average score of 2.54, 2.45 and 2.14, respectively.
Conclusion
The findings of this study showed that the majority of medical residents do not have sufficient awareness and knowledge about concepts of EBM and still not comprehend the necessity of using EBM databases. Therefore, planning for accepting and teaching Evidence based medicine and databases is essential.}

abstract={Computerized clinical decision support systems, or CDSS, represent a paradigm shift in healthcare today. CDSS are used to augment clinicians in their complex decision-making processes. Since their first use in the 1980s, CDSS have seen a rapid evolution. They are now commonly administered through electronic medical records and other computerized clinical workflows, which has been facilitated by increasing global adoption of electronic medical records with advanced capabilities. Despite these advances, there remain unknowns regarding the effect CDSS have on the providers who use them, patient outcomes, and costs. There have been numerous published examples in the past decade(s) of CDSS success stories, but notable setbacks have also shown us that CDSS are not without risks. In this paper, we provide a state-of-the-art overview on the use of clinical decision support systems in medicine, including the different types, current use cases with proven efficacy, common pitfalls, and potential harms. We conclude with evidence-based recommendations for minimizing risk in CDSS design, implementation, evaluation, and maintenance.},

Besides, two groups of additional factors, related to AIMDSS (task complexity, technology characteristics, and perceived substitution crisis) and health professionals' characteristics (propensity to trust and personal innovativeness in IT) are considered in the integrated model. The data set of proposed research model is collected through paper survey and Internet survey in China.

From an organizational perspective, AI devices have several advantages, by performing certain tasks quicker and more accurately in comparison to humans while at the same time being more cost-efficient. However, in order to maintain the high standards of a brand, they have to be accepted by consumers and deliver socially adequate performance. Therefore, it is important to determine the characteristics of AI devices which make them accepted and trusted by consumers. Based on the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) Theory, we have researched on the role of psychological anthropomorphic characteristics, perceived empathy, and interaction quality in the acceptance of AI devices in the service industry. The results show that anthropomorphic characteristics alone do not influence acceptance and trust towards AI devices. However, both perceived empathy and interaction quality mediate the relation between anthropomorphic characteristics and acceptance. A human-like AI device has higher acceptance when it has the ability to show empathy and interaction in relation to the human consumer. This result reveals the importance of developing forms of strong intelligence and empathetic behaviour in service robots and AI devices.}

abstract = { Background Although artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise across many aspects of radiology, the use of AI to create differential diagnoses for rare and common diseases at brain MRI has not been demonstrated. Purpose To evaluate an AI system for generation of differential diagnoses at brain MRI compared with radiologists. Materials and Methods This retrospective study tested performance of an AI system for probabilistic diagnosis in patients with 19 common and rare diagnoses at brain MRI acquired between January 2008 and January 2018. The AI system combines data-driven and domain-expertise methodologies, including deep learning and Bayesian networks. First, lesions were detected by using deep learning. Then, 18 quantitative imaging features were extracted by using atlas-based coregistration and segmentation. Third, these image features were combined with five clinical features by using Bayesian inference to develop probability-ranked differential diagnoses. Quantitative feature extraction algorithms and conditional probabilities were fine-tuned on a training set of 86 patients (mean age, 49 years ± 16 [standard deviation]; 53 women). Accuracy was compared with radiology residents, general radiologists, neuroradiology fellows, and academic neuroradiologists by using accuracy of top one, top two, and top three differential diagnoses in 92 independent test set patients (mean age, 47 years ± 18; 52 women). Results For accuracy of top three differential diagnoses, the AI system (91\% correct) performed similarly to academic neuroradiologists (86\% correct; P = .20), and better than radiology residents (56\%; P < .001), general radiologists (57\%; P < .001), and neuroradiology fellows (77\%; P = .003). The performance of the AI system was not affected by disease prevalence (93\% accuracy for common vs 85\% for rare diseases; P = .26). Radiologists were more accurate at diagnosing common versus rare diagnoses (78\% vs 47\% across all radiologists; P < .001). Conclusion An artificial intelligence system for brain MRI approached overall top one, top two, and top three differential diagnoses accuracy of neuroradiologists and exceeded that of less-specialized radiologists. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

Purpose To evaluate the performance of an artificial intelligence (AI) system for detection of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest radiographs. Materials and Methods An AI system (CAD4COVID-XRay) was trained on 24 678 chest radiographs, including 1540 used only for validation while training. The test set consisted of a set of continuously acquired chest radiographs (n = 454) obtained in patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia between March 4 and April 6, 2020, at one center (223 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] results, 231 with negative RT-PCR results). Radiographs were independently analyzed by six readers and by the AI system. Diagnostic performance was analyzed with the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results For the test set, the mean age of patients was 67 years ± 14.4 (standard deviation) (56\% male). With RT-PCR test results as the reference standard, the AI system correctly classified chest radiographs as COVID-19 pneumonia with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81. The system significantly outperformed each reader (P < .001 using the McNemar test) at their highest possible sensitivities. At their lowest sensitivities, only one reader significantly outperformed the AI system (P = .04). Conclusion The performance of an artificial intelligence system in the detection of coronavirus disease 2019 on chest radiographs was comparable with that of six independent readers. © RSNA, 2020 }

We investigated the attitudes of radiologists, information technology (IT) specialists, and industry representatives on artificial intelligence (AI) and its future impact on radiological work.
Materials and Methods
During a national meeting for AI, eHealth, and IT infrastructure in 2019, we conducted a survey to obtain participants’ attitudes. A total of 123 participants completed 28 items exploring AI usage in medicine. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify differences between radiologists, IT specialists, and industry representatives.
Results
The strongest agreement between all respondents occurred with the following: plausibility checks are important to understand the decisions of the AI (93\% agreement), validation of AI algorithms is mandatory (91\%), and medicine becomes more efficient in the age of AI (86\%). In contrast, only 25\% of the respondents had confidence in the AI results, and only 17\% believed that medicine will become more human through the use of AI. The answers were significantly different between the three professions for four items: relevance for protocol selection in cross-sectional imaging (p = 0.034), medical societies should be involved in validation (p = 0.028), patients should be informed about the use of AI (p = 0.047), and AI should be part of medical education (p = 0.026).
Conclusion
Currently, a discrepancy exists between high expectations for the future role of AI and low confidence in the results. This attitude was similar across all three groups. The demand for plausibility checks and the need to prove the usefulness in randomized controlled studies indicate what is needed in future research.}

We use a patient safety perspective to reflect on the development of a computerized cancer risk assessment tool embedded within a UK primary care electronic health record system.METHODSWe developed a computerized version of the CAncer Prevention in ExetER studies risk assessment tool, in compliance with the European Union's Medical Device Regulations. The process of building this tool afforded an opportunity to reflect on clinical concerns and whether current regulations for medical devices are fit for purpose. We identified concerns for patient safety and developed nine practical recommendations to mitigate these concerns.RESULTSWe noted that medical device regulations (1) were initially created for hardware devices rather than software, (2) offer one-shot approval rather than supporting iterative innovation and learning, (3) are biased toward loss-transfer approaches that attempt to manage the fallout of harm instead of mitigating hazards becoming harmful, and (4) are biased toward known hazards, despite unknown hazards being an expected consequence of health care as a complex adaptive system. Our nine recommendations focus on embedding less-reductionist and stronger system perspectives into regulations and standards.CONCLUSIONOur intention is to share our experience to support research-led collaborative development of health informatics solutions in cancer. We argue that regulations in the European Union do not sufficiently address the complexity of healthcare information systems with consequences for patient safety. Future standards and regulations should continue to follow a system-based approach to risk, safety, and accident avoidance. }

Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the awareness of AI among Korean doctors and to assess physicians' attitudes toward the medical application of AI. Methods: We conducted an online survey composed of 11 closed-ended questions using Google Forms. The survey consisted of questions regarding the recognition of and attitudes toward AI, the development direction of AI in medicine, and the possible risks of using AI in the medical field. Results: A total of 669 participants completed the survey. Only 40 (5.9{\%}) answered that they had good familiarity with AI. However, most participants considered AI useful in the medical field (558/669, 83.4{\%} agreement). The advantage of using AI was seen as the ability to analyze vast amounts of high-quality, clinically relevant data in real time. Respondents agreed that the area of medicine in which AI would be most useful is disease diagnosis (558/669, 83.4{\%} agreement). One possible problem cited by the participants was that AI would not be able to assist in unexpected situations owing to inadequate information (196/669, 29.3{\%}). Less than half of the participants(294/669, 43.9{\%}) agreed that AI is diagnostically superior to human doctors. Only 237 (35.4{\%}) answered that they agreed that AI could replace them in their jobs. Conclusions: This study suggests that Korean doctors and medical students have favorable attitudes toward AI in the medical field. The majority of physicians surveyed believed that AI will not replace their roles in the future. ",

abstract = {Introduction
Although the use of computerized decision support systems (CDSS) in glucose control in the ICU has been reported, little is known about the effect of the systems’ operating modes on the quality of glucose control. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of providing patient-specific and patient non-specific computerized advice on timing of blood glucose level (BGL) measurements. Our hypothesis was that both levels of support would be effective for improving the quality of glucose regulation and safety, with patient specific advice being the most effective strategy.
Patients and methods
A prospective study was performed in a 30-bed mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital. In phase 1 the CDSS provided non-specific advice and thereafter, in phase 2, the system provided specific advice on timing of BGL measurements. The primary outcome measure was delay in BGL measurements before and after the two levels of support. Secondary endpoints were sampling frequency, mean BGL, BGL within pre-defined targets, time to capture target, incidences of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. These indicators were analyzed over the course of time using Statistical Control Charts. The analysis was restricted to patients with at least two blood glucose measurements.
Results
Data of 3934 patient admissions were evaluated, which corresponded to 119,116 BGL measurements. The BGL sampling interval, delays in BG sampling, and percentage of hypoglycemia all decreased after introducing either of the two levels of decision support. The effect was however larger for the patient specific CDSS. Mean BGL, time to capture target, hyperglycemia index, percentage of hyperglycemia events and “in range” measurements remained unchanged and stable after introducing both patient non-specific and patient specific decision support.
Conclusion
Adherence to protocol sampling rules increased by using decision support with a larger effect at the patient specific level. This led to a decrease in the percentage of hypoglycemia events and improved safety. The use of the CDSS at both levels, however, did not improve the quality of glucose control as measured by our indicators. More research is needed to investigate whether other socio-technical factors are in play.}

abstract = {Abstract This article is the American Cancer Society’s update on female breast cancer statistics in the United States, including population-based data on incidence, mortality, survival, and mammography screening. Breast cancer incidence rates have risen in most of the past four decades; during the most recent data years (2010–2019), the rate increased by 0.5\% annually, largely driven by localized-stage and hormone receptor-positive disease. In contrast, breast cancer mortality rates have declined steadily since their peak in 1989, albeit at a slower pace in recent years (1.3\% annually from 2011 to 2020) than in the previous decade (1.9\% annually from 2002 to 2011). In total, the death rate dropped by 43\% during 1989–2020, translating to 460,000 fewer breast cancer deaths during that time. The death rate declined similarly for women of all racial/ethnic groups except American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom the rates were stable. However, despite a lower incidence rate in Black versus White women (127.8 vs. 133.7 per 100,000), the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality remained unwavering, with the death rate 40\% higher in Black women overall (27.6 vs. 19.7 deaths per 100,000 in 2016–2020) and two-fold higher among adult women younger than 50 years (12.1 vs. 6.5 deaths per 100,000). Black women have the lowest 5-year relative survival of any racial/ethnic group for every molecular subtype and stage of disease (except stage I), with the largest Black–White gaps in absolute terms for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative disease (88\% vs. 96\%), hormone receptor-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease (78\% vs. 86\%), and stage III disease (64\% vs. 77\%). Progress against breast cancer mortality could be accelerated by mitigating racial disparities through increased access to high-quality screening and treatment via nationwide Medicaid expansion and partnerships between community stakeholders, advocacy organizations, and health systems.},

abstract = {Schizophrenia (SZ) is a mental disorder that typically emerges in late adolescence or early adulthood. It reduces the life expectancy of patients by 15 years. Abnormal behavior, perception of emotions, social relationships, and reality perception are among its most significant symptoms. Past studies have revealed that SZ affects the temporal and anterior lobes of hippocampus regions of the brain. Also, increased volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and decreased volume of white and gray matter can be observed due to this disease. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the popular neuroimaging technique used to explore structural/functional brain abnormalities in SZ disorder, owing to its high spatial resolution. Various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been employed with advanced image/signal processing methods to accurately diagnose SZ. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of studies conducted on the automated diagnosis of SZ using MRI modalities. First, an AI-based computer aided-diagnosis system (CADS) for SZ diagnosis and its relevant sections are presented. Then, this section introduces the most important conventional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques in the diagnosis of diagnosing SZ. A comprehensive comparison is also made between ML and DL studies in the discussion section. In the following, the most important challenges in diagnosing SZ are addressed. Future works in diagnosing SZ using AI techniques and MRI modalities are recommended in another section. Results, conclusion, and research findings are also presented at the end.}

abstract = {We addressed the issues related to repeated measures experimental design such as an AB/BA crossover design that have been neither discussed nor addressed in the software engineering literature.Firstly, there are potentially two different standardized mean difference effect sizes that can be calculated, depending on whether the mean difference is standardized by the pooled within groups variance or the within-participants variance. Hence, we provided equations for non-standardized and standardized effect sizes and explained the need for two different types of standardized effect size, one for the repeated measures and one that would be equivalent to an independent groups design.Secondly, as for any estimated parameters and also for the purposes of undertaking meta-analysis, it is necessary to calculate the variance of the standardized mean difference effect sizes (which is not the same as the variance of the study). Hence, we provided formulas for the small sample size effect size variance and the medium sample size approximation to the effect size variance, for both types of standardized effect size.We also presented the model underlying the AB/BA crossover design and provided two examples (an empirical analysis of the real data set by Scanniello, as well as simulated data) to demonstrate how to construct the two standardized mean difference effect sizes and their variances, both from standard descriptive statistics and from the outputs provided by the linear mixed model package lme4 in R.A conclusion is that crossover designs should be considered (instead of between groups design) only if:• previous research has suggested that ρ is greater than zero and preferably greater than 0.25;• there is either strong theoretical argument, or empirical evidence from a well-powered study, that the period by technique interaction is negligible.Summarizing, our journal first paper [3]:(1) Presents the formulas needed to calculate both non-standardized and standardized mean difference effect sizes for AB/BA crossover designs (see Section 4 and 5 of our paper [3]).(2) Presents the formulas needed to estimate the variances of the non-standardized and standardized effect sizes which in the later cases need to be appropriate for the small to medium sample sizes commonly used in software engineering crossover designs (see Section 5 of our paper [3]).(3) Explains how to calculate the effect sizes and their variances both from the descriptive statistics that should be reported and from the raw data (see Section 6 of our paper [3]).It is worth mentioning that we based our formulas on our own corrections to the formulas presented earlier by Curtin et al. [1]. Our corrections for the variances of standardized weighted mean difference of an AB/BA cross-over trial were accepted by the author of the original formulas (Curtin), submitted jointly as a letter to Editor of Statistics in Medicine to assure the widespread (also beyond the software engineering domain) adoption of the corrected formulas, and accepted [2]. We proposed an alternative formulation of the standardized effect size for individual difference effects that is comparable with the standardized effect size commonly used for pretest/posttest studies. We also corrected the small sample size and moderate sample size variances reported by Curtin et al. for both the individual difference effect size and the standardized effect size comparable to independent groups trials, showing the derivation of the formulas from the variance of a t-variable. Using these results, researchers can now correctly calculate standardized effect size variances, allowing the calculation of confidence intervals for AB/BA cross-over trials, which in turn provides a direct link to null hypothesis testing and supports meta-analysis. Meta-analysts can now validly aggregate together results from independent groups, pretest/posttest and AB/BA cross-over trials. Last but not least, the presented contributions allow corrections of previously reported results.},

The present meta-analysis aims to examine the strength of the relationship between PSU symptoms and global self-esteem. A keyword-based systematic literature search was performed to identify studies in which PSU symptoms and global self-esteem were assessed. Thirty-one independent studies with a total of 27.004 participants (F \% = 54.21\%; mean age = 17.37 ± 4.97; range: 12.10–34.39 years old) were included. Meta-analytic results of the random effects model applied to a total of 31 independent samples show a negative correlation between self-esteem and PSU (Fisher's Z = −0.25; CI -0.28, −0.21; Z = −14.63; p < 0.001). Age, gender and geographical area did not moderate the association. The magnitude of the effect size can be considered small according to Cohen's criteria (1992), and medium according to Hemphill's criteria (2003). The sensitivity analysis and analyses of publication bias confirm that these results are robust. The findings show that low self-esteem is an important hallmark of PSU. Overall, our findings emphasize the importance of addressing self-esteem and corresponding core beliefs in the prevention and treatment of PSU.}

New robots are being introduced for the growing subpopulation of healthy older adults, with an emphasis on supporting the positive aspects of aging. In order to inform the design and implementation of such robots, the relevant needs and concerns of this population should be studied, mapped, and translated into recommendations. We present a qualitative study of thirty cognitively-intact older adults, evaluating their attitudes and emotional reactions towards different types of home robotic devices. Interview analysis of participants reactions to videos of six devices uncovered four user needs that can be threatened by the introduction of home robots: the need for independence, the need for control, the fear of being replaced, and the need for authenticity. Furthermore, results reveal that cognitively-intact older adults are willing to adopt robotic devices into their homes, contingent upon their preferences and concerns being addressed. We provide recommendations regarding how researchers and designers of home robots can better address the user needs of healthy older adults by leveraging aspects of the robot's function, speech, appearance, size, proactivity, and mobility.}

However, empirical evidence for their effectiveness is fragmented and mixed. Thus, literature has called for more rigorous studies – including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) – to investigate the effectiveness of AAL technologies. In this paper, we present findings from a longitudinal RCT over 12 months (N = 150) evaluating an AAL technology that aims to support older adults’ self-determination, social participation, and perceived safety. Results do not indicate significant effects on the measured outcomes. Based on complementary methods employed in the study (tracking of usage behavior, quantitative self-reports on user experience, qualitative interviews) and our practical experiences with the implementation of the WAALTeR project we critically reflect on this finding and explore possible explanations. This reflection reveals systematic challenges that exist not only in relation to the present study but also in relation to the evaluation of AAL technologies more generally. Based on these insights, we offer implications and directions for future research that aim to better understand and overcome challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of AAL technologies.}

    abstract = { Purpose To evaluate the ability of fine-grained annotations to overcome shortcut learning in deep learning (DL)–based diagnosis using chest radiographs. Materials and Methods Two DL models were developed using radiograph-level annotations (disease present: yes or no) and fine-grained lesion-level annotations (lesion bounding boxes), respectively named CheXNet and CheXDet. A total of 34 501 chest radiographs obtained from January 2005 to September 2019 were retrospectively collected and annotated regarding cardiomegaly, pleural effusion, mass, nodule, pneumonia, pneumothorax, tuberculosis, fracture, and aortic calcification. The internal classification performance and lesion localization performance of the models were compared on a testing set (n = 2922); external classification performance was compared on National Institutes of Health (NIH) Google (n = 4376) and PadChest (n = 24 536) datasets; and external lesion localization performance was compared on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset (n = 880). The models were also compared with radiologist performance on a subset of the internal testing set (n = 496). Performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results Given sufficient training data, both models performed similarly to radiologists. CheXDet achieved significant improvement for external classification, such as classifying fracture on NIH Google (CheXDet area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.67; CheXNet AUC, 0.51; P < .001) and PadChest (CheXDet AUC, 0.78; CheXNet AUC, 0.55; P < .001). CheXDet achieved higher lesion detection performance than CheXNet for most abnormalities on all datasets, such as detecting pneumothorax on the internal set (CheXDet jackknife alternative free-response ROC [JAFROC] figure of merit [FOM], 0.87; CheXNet JAFROC FOM, 0.13; P < .001) and NIH ChestX-ray14 (CheXDet JAFROC FOM, 0.55; CheXNet JAFROC FOM, 0.04; P < .001). Conclusion Fine-grained annotations overcame shortcut learning and enabled DL models to identify correct lesion patterns, improving the generalizability of the models.

    abstract = "{Over the next decade, many health care organizations (HCOs) will transition from one electronic health record (EHR) to another; some forced by hospital acquisition and others by choice in search of better EHRs. Herein, we apply principles of Requisite Imagination, or the ability to imagine key aspects of the future one is planning, to offer 6 recommendations on how to proactively safeguard these transitions. First, HCOs should implement a proactive leadership structure that values communication. Second, HCOs should implement proactive risk assessment and testing processes. Third, HCOs should anticipate and reduce unwarranted variation in their EHR and clinical processes. Fourth, HCOs should establish a culture of conscious inquiry with routine system monitoring. Fifth, HCOs should foresee and reduce information access problems. Sixth, HCOs should support their workforce through difficult EHR transitions. Proactive approaches using Requisite Imagination principles outlined here can help ensure safe, effective, and economically sound EHR transitions.}",

abstract = {<p> <strong>Purpose:</strong> Fatigue may lead to high medical errors by the radiologists. Fatigue is often described as feelings of weakness, lack of energy, and a desire to rest, and is associated with impairments in the ability to function. Visual fatigue has importance in medical imaging as errors (false-negatives) are relatively common. Blinded independent central review (BICR) is a well-used method employed in many oncology registration trials. Ongoing monitoring of radiologist “reviewer” performance is both good clinical trial practice and a requirement by regulatory authorities. We use reader disagreement index (RDI) as a potential tool to identify reader fatigue and compare reader fatigue in reviewers performing single versus multiple types of study. </p> <p> <strong>Methods: </strong>A retrospective analysis of reviewers’ RDI in four different clinical trials were performed. Fourteen reviewers’ performance was analyzed with data for 3750 subjects having a total of 15105 timepoints across all clinical trials. These individual trial reviews were conducted by 14 board-certified radiologist reviewers using several established imaging assessment trial criteria. The objective of the study was to establish RDI as an effective tool to analyze if it could be a good surrogate marker for quality impacted by reader fatigue. </p> <p> <strong>Results:</strong> The results indicate the RDI can be used as a tool to track reader quality which in turn may be able to predict reader fatigue. In the random pool of readers and studies analyzed, we did not notice any major trend or impact on read quality given that these trials were anyway actively monitored for read volume distribution and quality. </p> <strong>Conclusions:</strong> Fatigue may lead to high medical errors by the radiologists. RDI can be used as a good surrogate for read quality to monitor reader fatigue. Based on the results, it can be said that it is better to undertake more cases in a single study than undertake less number of cases in different types of studies to prevent reader fatigue. },

    abstract = { Research has not yet quantified the effects of workload or duty hours on the accuracy of radiologists. With the exception of a brief reduction in imaging studies during the 2020 peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the workload of radiologists in the United States has seen relentless growth in recent years. One concern is that this increased demand could lead to reduced accuracy. Behavioral studies in species ranging from insects to humans have shown that decision speed is inversely correlated to decision accuracy. A potential solution is to institute workload and duty limits to optimize radiologist performance and patient safety. The concern, however, is that any prescribed mandated limits would be arbitrary and thus no more advantageous than allowing radiologists to self-regulate. Specific studies have been proposed to determine whether limits reduce error, and if so, to provide a principled basis for such limits. This could determine the precise susceptibility of individual radiologists to medical error as a function of speed during image viewing, the maximum number of studies that could be read during a work shift, and the appropriate shift duration as a function of time of day. Before principled recommendations for restrictions are made, however, it is important to understand how radiologists function both optimally and at the margins of adequate performance. This study examines the relationship between interpretation speed and error rates in radiology, the potential influence of artificial intelligence on reading speed and error rates, and the possible outcomes of imposed limits on both caseload and duty hours. This review concludes that the scientific evidence needed to make meaningful rules is lacking and notes that regulating workloads without scientific principles can be more harmful than not regulating at all. © RSNA, 2022 }

We interviewed 20 healthcare providers in asthma care to envision future technologies to support their PGHD use. We found that healthcare providers want future artificial intelligence (AI) systems to enhance their ability to treat patients by analyzing PGHD for profiling risk and predicting deterioration. Despite the potential benefits of AI, providers perceived various challenges of AI use with PGHD, including AI-driven data inequity, added burden, lack of trust toward AI, and fear of being replaced by AI. Clinicians wished for a future of co-dependent human-AI collaboration, where AI will help them to improve their clinical practice. In turn, healthcare providers can improve AI systems by making AI outputs more trustworthy and humane. Through the lens of data feminism, we discuss the importance of considering context and aligning the complex human infrastructure before designing or deploying PGHD-based AI systems in clinical settings. We highlight the opportunity to design for human-AI enrichment, where humans and AI not only partner with each other for improved performance, but also enrich each other to enhance each other's work overtime.},

To provide a more proactive and pragmatic perspective, this article highlights the complementarity of humans and AI and examines how each can bring their own strength in organizational decision-making processes typically characterized by uncertainty, complexity, and equivocality. With a greater computational information processing capacity and an analytical approach, AI can extend humans’ cognition when addressing complexity, whereas humans can still offer a more holistic, intuitive approach in dealing with uncertainty and equivocality in organizational decision making. This premise mirrors the idea of intelligence augmentation, which states that AI systems should be designed with the intention of augmenting, not replacing, human contributions.}

abstract = {Supervised machine learning approaches commonly require good availability and quality of training data. In applications that depend on human-labeled data, especially from experts, or that depend on contextual knowledge for training data sets, the human-in-the-loop presents a serious bottleneck to the scalability of training efforts. Even if human labeling is generally feasible, sustained human performance and high-quality labels in larger quantities are challenging. Interactive Machine Learning can help solve usability problems in traditional machine learning by giving users agency in deciding how systems learn from data. Yet, the field lacks clear design guidelines for such interfaces, specifically regarding the scaling of training processes. In this paper, we present results from a pilot study in which participants interacted with several interface variants of a recommender engine and evaluated them on interaction and efficiency parameters. Based on the performance of these different learning system implementations we propose design guidelines for the design of such systems and a score for comparative evaluation, in which we combine interaction experience and system learning efficiency into one relative scoring unit.},

abstract = {Both philosophers and psychologists have argued for the existence of distinct kinds of explanations, including teleological explanations that cite functions or goals, and mechanistic explanations that cite causal mechanisms. Theories of causation, in contrast, have generally been unitary, with dominant theories focusing either on counterfactual dependence or on physical connections. This paper argues that both approaches to causation are psychologically real, with different modes of explanation promoting judgments more or less consistent with each approach. Two sets of experiments isolate the contributions of counterfactual dependence and physical connections in causal ascriptions involving events with people, artifacts, or biological traits, and manipulate whether the events are construed teleologically or mechanistically. The findings suggest that when events are construed teleologically, causal ascriptions are sensitive to counterfactual dependence and relatively insensitive to the presence of physical connections, but when events are construed mechanistically, causal ascriptions are sensitive to both counterfactual dependence and physical connections. The conclusion introduces an account of causation, an “exportable dependence theory,” that provides a way to understand the contributions of physical connections and teleology in terms of the functions of causal ascriptions.}

They allow a user to understand why an application is behaving a certain way, and to change its behavior. Because of their importance to end users, they must be addressed at an interface level. However, often the sensors or machine learning systems that users need to understand and control are created long before a specific application is built, or created separately from the application interface. Thus, supporting interface designers in building intelligibility and control into interfaces requires application logic and underlying infrastructure to be exposed in some structured fashion. As context-aware infrastructures do not provide generalized support for this, we extended one such infrastructure with Situations, components that appropriately exposes application logic, and supports debugging and simple intelligibility and control interfaces, while making it easier for an application developer to build context-aware applications and facilitating designer access to application state and behavior. We developed support for interface designers in Visual Basic and Flash. We demonstrate the usefulness of this support through an evaluation of programmers, an evaluation of the usability of the new infrastructure with interface designers, and the augmentation of three common context-aware applications.},

abstract = {Abstract Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.},

The chapter describes methods for building CDSSs, which include context-specific information retrieval, grouping information within order sets, learning from data, and the use of declarative knowledge representations. The landscape for deploying CDSS technology is evolving rapidly, and the chapter discusses current standards and challenges for CDSS implementation. It concludes with a presentation of opportunities for future research.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of
              computer-aided detection (CAD) systems on the performance of
              radiologists with digital mammograms acquired during the Digital
              Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (DMIST). MATERIALS AND
              METHODS: Only those DMIST cases with proven cancer status by
              biopsy or 1-year follow-up that had available digital images were
              included in this multireader, multicase ROC study. Two
              commercially available CAD systems for digital mammography were
              used: iCAD SecondLook, version 1.4; and R2 ImageChecker Cenova,
              version 1.0. Fourteen radiologists interpreted, without and with
              CAD, a set of 300 cases (150 cancer, 150 benign or normal) on the
              iCAD SecondLook system, and 15 radiologists interpreted a
              different set of 300 cases (150 cancer, 150 benign or normal) on
              the R2 ImageChecker Cenova system. RESULTS: The average AUC was
              0.71 (95\% CI, 0.66-0.76) without and 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.67-0.77)
              with the iCAD system (p = 0.07). Similarly, the average AUC was
              0.71 (95\% CI, 0.66-0.76) without and 0.72 (95\% CI 0.67-0.77)
              with the R2 system (p = 0.08). Sensitivity and specificity
              differences without and with CAD for both systems also were not
              significant. CONCLUSION: Radiologists in our studies rarely
              changed their diagnostic decisions after the addition of CAD. The
              application of CAD had no statistically significant effect on
              radiologist AUC, sensitivity, or specificity performance with
              digital mammograms from DMIST.",

The analysis illustrates a rich range of concepts and findings towards understanding the work of healthcare but the work on the larger policy level is lacking.

abstract = {Breast Cancer (BC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of mortality among women. About 1 in 8 US women (about 13\%) will develop invasive BC throughout their lifetime. Early detection of this life-threatening disease not only increases the survival rate but also reduces the treatment cost. Fortunately, advancements in radiographic imaging like “Mammograms”, “Computed Tomography (CT)”, “Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)”, “3D Mammography”, and “Histopathological Imaging (HI)” have made it feasible to diagnose this life-taking disease at an early stage. However, the analysis of radiographic images and Histopathological images is done by experienced radiologists and pathologists, respectively. The process is not only costly but also error-prone. Over the last ten years, Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML) have transformed the world in every way possible. Deep learning (DL), a subfield of ML has shown outstanding results in a variety of fields, particularly in the biomedical industry, because of its ability to handle large amounts of data. DL techniques automatically extract the features by analyzing the high dimensional and correlated data efficiently. The potential and ability of DL models have also been utilized and evaluated in the identification and prognosis of BC, utilizing radiographic and Histopathological images, and have performed admirably. However, AI has shown good claims in retrospective studies only. External validations are needed for translating these cutting-edge AI tools as a clinical decision maker. The main aim of this research work is to present the critical analysis of the research and findings already done to detect and classify BC using various imaging modalities including “Mammography”, “Histopathology”, “Ultrasound”, “PET/CT”, “MRI”, and “Thermography”. At first, a detailed review of the past research papers using Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning for BC classification and detection is carried out. We also review the publicly available datasets for the above-mentioned imaging modalities to make future research more accessible. Finally, a critical discussion section has been included to elaborate open research difficulties and prospects for future study in this emerging area, demonstrating the limitations of Deep Learning approaches.}

abstract={Although anaesthesiologists strive to avoid hypoxaemia during surgery, reliably predicting future intraoperative hypoxaemia is not possible at present. Here, we report the development and testing of a machine-learning-based system that predicts the risk of hypoxaemia and provides explanations of the risk factors in real time during general anaesthesia. The system, which was trained on minute-by-minute data from the electronic medical records of over 50,000 surgeries, improved the performance of anaesthesiologists by providing interpretable hypoxaemia risks and contributing factors. The explanations for the predictions are broadly consistent with the literature and with prior knowledge from anaesthesiologists. Our results suggest that if anaesthesiologists currently anticipate 15{\%} of hypoxaemia events, with the assistance of this system they could anticipate 30{\%}, a large portion of which may benefit from early intervention because they are associated with modifiable factors. The system can help improve the clinical understanding of hypoxaemia risk during anaesthesia care by providing general insights into the exact changes in risk induced by certain characteristics of the patient or procedure.},

abstract={Tree-based machine learning models such as random forests, decision trees and gradient boosted trees are popular nonlinear predictive models, yet comparatively little attention has been paid to explaining their predictions. Here we improve the interpretability of tree-based models through three main contributions. (1) A polynomial time algorithm to compute optimal explanations based on game theory. (2) A new type of explanation that directly measures local feature interaction effects. (3) A new set of tools for understanding global model structure based on combining many local explanations of each prediction. We apply these tools to three medical machine learning problems and show how combining many high-quality local explanations allows us to represent global structure while retaining local faithfulness to the original model. These tools enable us to (1) identify high-magnitude but low-frequency nonlinear mortality risk factors in the US population, (2) highlight distinct population subgroups with shared risk characteristics, (3) identify nonlinear interaction effects among risk factors for chronic kidney disease and (4) monitor a machine learning model deployed in a hospital by identifying which features are degrading the model's performance over time. Given the popularity of tree-based machine learning models, these improvements to their interpretability have implications across a broad set of domains.},

However, prior studies observed improvements from explanations only when the AI, alone, outperformed both the human and the best team. Can explanations help lead to complementary performance, where team accuracy is higher than either the human or the AI working solo? We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI’s recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?},

If yes, and if the failure to meet such standards can be attributed to epistemic opacity, then explainability is a requirement for AI in healthcare. If not, then based on at least one metric of ethical medical practice (informed consent), explainability is not required for the ethical use of AI in healthcare. First, I show that the use of epistemically opaque AI applications is compatible with meeting accepted legal criteria for informed consent. Second, I argue that human experts are also black boxes with respect to the criteria by which they arrive at a diagnosis. Human experts can nonetheless meet established requirements for informed consent. I conclude that the use of black-box AI systems does not violate patients' rights to informed consent, and thus, with respect to informed consent, explainability is not required for medical AI.},

abstract={The present study investigates teacher diagnostic skills when observing student engagement and inferring to underlying student characteristic profiles. Five student profiles as empirically determined in previous studies are selected: three incoherent (overestimating, uninterested, and underestimating) and two coherent (strong and struggling) profiles. Teacher professional vision and underlying assumptions about processes of noticing and reasoning about the chosen diagnostic situation serve as a conceptual basis. In the empirical study (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}41 participants), it is investigated to what extent expert and novice teachers differ with regard to judgment accuracy of underlying student profiles, observed student cues used for judgment, and teacher gaze as perceptual indicator. The study task involved observing a video clip and diagnosing five marked students based on their underlying profiles. First, findings of the study suggest that expert teachers are more accurate in judging incoherent profiles compared to novices. Second, both novices as well as experts state valid behavioral cues when inferring from student engagement to underlying student profile. Third, experts spend more teacher gaze on student profiles which might need adaptive pedagogical action (struggling, underestimating, uninterested student). The study provides first evidence on teacher gaze during the professional task of diagnosing individual students in the process of teaching. Regarding the conceptual model of teacher professional vision teacher gaze can serve as an additional operationalization of the noticing component of teacher professional vision.},

abstract = {AI-mediated communication (AI-MC) represents a new paradigm where communication is augmented or generated by an intelligent system. As AI-MC becomes more prevalent, it is important to understand the effects that it has on human interactions and interpersonal relationships. Previous work tells us that in human interactions with intelligent systems, misattribution is common and trust is developed and handled differently than in interactions between humans. This study uses a 2 (successful vs. unsuccessful conversation) x 2 (standard vs. AI-mediated messaging app) between subjects design to explore whether AI mediation has any effects on attribution and trust. We show that the presence of AI-generated smart replies serves to increase perceived trust between human communicators and that, when things go awry, the AI seems to be perceived as a coercive agent, allowing it to function like a moral crumple zone and lessen the responsibility assigned to the other human communicator. These findings suggest that smart replies could be used to improve relationships and perceptions of conversational outcomes between interlocutors. Our findings also add to existing literature regarding perceived agency in smart agents by illustrating that in this type of AI-MC, the AI is considered to have agency only when communication goes awry.}

abstract = {The need for advanced automation and artificial intelligence (AI) in various fields, including text classification, has dramatically increased in the last decade, leaving us critically dependent on their performance and reliability. Yet, as we increasingly rely more on AI applications, their algorithms are becoming more nuanced, more complex, and less understandable precisely at a time we need to understand them better and trust them to perform as expected. Text classification in the medical and cybersecurity domains is a good example of a task where we may wish to keep the human in the loop. Human experts lack the capacity to deal with the high volume and velocity of data that needs to be classified, and ML techniques are often unexplainable and lack the ability to capture the required context needed to make the right decision and take action. We propose a new abstract configuration of Human-Machine Learning (HML) that focuses on reciprocal learning, where the human and the AI are collaborating partners. We employ design-science research (DSR) to learn and design an application of the HML configuration, which incorporates software to support combining human and artificial intelligences. We define the HML configuration by its conceptual components and their function. We then describe the development of a system called Fusion that supports human-machine reciprocal learning. Using two case studies of text classification from the cyber domain, we evaluate Fusion and the proposed HML approach, demonstrating benefits and challenges. Our results show a clear ability of domain experts to improve the ML classification performance over time, while both human and machine, collaboratively, develop their conceptualization, i.e., their knowledge of classification. We generalize our insights from the DSR process as actionable principles for researchers and designers of 'human in the learning loop' systems. We conclude the paper by discussing HML configurations and the challenge of capturing and representing knowledge gained jointly by human and machine, an area we feel has great potential.},

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) share common roots and early work on conversational agents has laid the foundation for both fields. However, in subsequent decades the initial tight connection between the fields has become less pronounced. The recent rise of deep learning has revolutionized AI and has led to a raft of practical methods and tools that significantly impact areas outside of core-AI. In particular, modern AI techniques now power new ways for machines and humans to interact. Thus it is timely to investigate how modern AI can propel HCI research in new ways and how HCI research can help direct AI developments. This workshop offers a forum for researchers to discuss new opportunities that lie in bringing modern AI methods into HCI research, identifying important problems to investigate, showcasing computational and scientific methods that can be applied, and sharing datasets and tools that are already available or proposing those that should be further developed. The topics we are interested in including deep learning methods for understanding and modeling human behaviors and enabling new interaction modalities, hybrid intelligence that combine human and machine intelligence to solve difficult tasks, and tools and methods for interaction data curation and large-scale data-driven design. At the core of these topics, we want to start the conversation on how data-driven and data-centric approaches of modern AI can impact HCI.},

abstract = {Machine learning has made rapid advances in safety-critical applications, such as traffic control, finance, and healthcare. With the criticality of decisions they support and the potential consequences of following their recommendations, it also became critical to provide users with explanations to interpret machine learning models in general, and black-box models in particular. However, despite the agreement on explainability as a necessity, there is little evidence on how recent advances in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence literature (XAI) can be applied in collaborative decision-making tasks, i.e., human decision-maker and an AI system working together, to contribute to the process of trust calibration effectively. This research conducts an empirical study to evaluate four XAI classes for their impact on trust calibration. We take clinical decision support systems as a case study and adopt a within-subject design followed by semi-structured interviews. We gave participants clinical scenarios and XAI interfaces as a basis for decision-making and rating tasks. Our study involved 41 medical practitioners who use clinical decision support systems frequently. We found that users perceive the contribution of explanations to trust calibration differently according to the XAI class and to whether XAI interface design fits their job constraints and scope. We revealed additional requirements on how explanations shall be instantiated and designed to help a better trust calibration. Finally, we build on our findings and present guidelines for designing XAI interfaces.}

abstract = {Details of the designs and mechanisms in support of human-AI collaboration must be considered in the real-world fielding of AI technologies. A critical aspect of interaction design for AI-assisted human decision making are policies about the display and sequencing of AI inferences within larger decision-making workflows. We have a poor understanding of the influences of making AI inferences available before versus after human review of a diagnostic task at hand. We explore the effects of providing AI assistance at the start of a diagnostic session in radiology versus after the radiologist has made a provisional decision. We conducted a user study where 19 veterinary radiologists identified radiographic findings present in patients’ X-ray images, with the aid of an AI tool. We employed two workflow configurations to analyze (i) anchoring effects, (ii) human-AI team diagnostic performance and agreement, (iii) time spent and confidence in decision making, and (iv) perceived usefulness of the AI. We found that participants who are asked to register provisional responses in advance of reviewing AI inferences are less likely to agree with the AI regardless of whether the advice is accurate and, in instances of disagreement with the AI, are less likely to seek the second opinion of a colleague. These participants also reported that the AI advice to be less useful. Surprisingly, requiring provisional decisions on cases in advance of the display of AI inferences did not lengthen the time participants spent on the task. The study provides generalizable and actionable insights for the deployment of clinical AI tools in human-in-the-loop systems and introduces a methodology for studying alternative designs for human-AI collaboration. We make our experimental platform available as open source to facilitate future research on the influence of alternate designs on human-AI workflows.},

With an efficient exploitation of digital medical data for diagnosis assistance, federated learning (FL) is promising in future digital health care. However, in multiple task performances, federated nodes deployed at the edge of IHS are constrained by computing and storage resources, as well as increased privacy breach risks. On account of these challenges, this paper proposes a more elaborated cloud–edge collaboration (CEC) framework of IHS combining FL and blockchain. Thus, a bi-level optimization scheduling IHS model is proposed, considering the large-scale access requirement of distributed generation (DG), energy storage (ES) and controllable load (CL) access to the IHS. Simulation results confirm an effective reduction of execution delay and power consumption, and a better interest coordination among multi-stakeholders.}

Even if novel added-value IoT-based applications appear on the market with increasing speed, true semantic interoperability is far from being achieved, thus limiting the large-scale exploitation, the scalability and the time-to-market of novel apps. Currently, connecting different data prosumers with multiple data sources is still hampered by the lack of standardized and sustainable solutions, especially due to the significant heterogeneity of IoT platforms. In such a landscape, ontologies come to the rescue, thanks to their formal semantics, knowledge representation formats, and shared vocabularies. In this paper we examine, from an ontological perspective, how to describe environmental sensing and wellness monitoring, two of the most popular application cases of Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) and IoT, respectively. To this purpose, an ontology of sensor-agnostic APIs is proposed, along with a set of MCS-dedicated ontology modules (and the supporting platform), leveraging on standard and reusable domain ontologies. Moreover, it will be shown how to properly combine the proposed ontologies in order to support complex functionalities based on inference rules addressing the environment–wellness relationships. Finally, specific semantic modeling patterns suitable for typical IoT and MCS scenarios will be discussed.}

Our objectives were to (1) design and develop an app for use by CHWs; and (2) conduct preliminary testing of the app to identify potential obstacles.Methods We used the principle of human-centred design to develop an app programmed to an Android operating system. We used a mixed-methods approach which included site observations, meetings with stakeholders and the app development team, and laboratory simulation to fine tune the design. The {\textquoteleft}Mobile Application Rating Scale{\textquoteright} (MARS) was used for testing reliability and quality. We also assessed the validity of the app by matching the uploaded data with {\textquoteleft}gold standard{\textquoteright} preset answers.Results Depending on human{\textendash}computer interactions, the app has reminder, advisor, critic and guide functions which can facilitate CHWs to make clinical decisions. We found the app is usable based on the final score of the MARS tool, and that the entered data were accurate. We present the simple procedures that were followed to develop this Android app. The app, including all of its code, is freely available.Conclusion The app shows promise as a tool for the management of non-communicable disease in a rural setting in India. The next step will be to refine the app in a field setting and then to evaluate its efficacy in a large-scale clinical trial.},

Research through Design (RtD) contributes new frames along with design work demonstrating a frame's value. Interestingly, RtD papers rarely describe how reframing happens. This gap in documentation unintentionally implies a romantic account of design, it implies that the first step of an RtD project is to have a brilliant idea. This is especially problematic in cases where the reframing causes a pivot that leads to a new research program. To help address this gap, we describe a case where through a series of three design experiments we experienced a research pivot. We describe how our work to improve web-table navigation for screen-reader users broke our frame. The break led to a new research program focused on constructing a conversational internet. This paper offers our case along with reflection on reporting design work that drives reframing.},

Therefore early diagnosis of breast cancer can minimize the human life risk. Mammograms and ultrasound imaging technologies play a crucial role to detect intraductal papillomas. However, the determination process of intraductal papillomas requires histopathological image analysis which may be mostly time-consuming, subjective, and tedious if carried out manually by the experts. To cover issue, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems came into consideration. However, earlier CAD systems could not achieve significant improvement in the diagnosis process and their usage of them did not become widespread for more than a decade. Since deep learning has made so many significant advances in a wide variety of image applications, CAD systems that use its principles perform as well as the experts in stand-alone mode, and even perform better when used in support mode. In this chapter, we utilized various deep learning architectures for the detection process of breast cancer on the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) dataset which is one of the most popular and remarkable datasets in this field. According to the results, the pretrained VGG16 and MobileNet architectures obtain the best detection performance, reaching nearly 92% classification accuracy.}

abstract = {A new synthesis is emerging that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies with Human-Computer Interaction to produce Human-Centered AI (HCAI). Advocates of this new synthesis seek to amplify, augment, and enhance human abilities, so as to empower people, build their self-efficacy, support creativity, recognize responsibility, and promote social connections.Researchers, developers, business leaders, policy makers and others are expanding the technology-centered scope of AI to include HCAI ways of thinking. This expansion from an algorithm-focused view to embrace a human-centered perspective, can shape the future of technology so as to better serve human needs. Educators, designers, software engineers, product managers, evaluators, and government agency staffers can build on AI-driven technologies to design products and services that make life better for the users. These human-centered products and services will enable people to better care for each other, build sustainable communities, and restore the environment. The passionate advocates of HCAI are devoted to furthering human values, rights, justice, and dignity, by building reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems.Early hypertext systems required user assigned links for text files, giving full control to users, while providing readers with an understandable and predictable design. However, innovators quickly realized that there were many strategies to improve hypertext designs by giving users spatial presentations of the related documents, recommendations for links, ways to collaborate, and interactive animated graphical presentations. Other features supported history-keeping, note-taking, and audio for all users, but especially for users with visual disabilities.Over time improved hypertext systems incorporated machine learning and other artificial intelligence techniques that provided automation of features, but sometimes produced unexpected and incomprehensible results. Current strategies are to give users more control by providing previews of potential traversals, reminders, alerts, and suggestions that guide human reflection about their goals and methods. Atzenbeck et al. suggest that hypertext is a method of inquiry, opening the door to creativity support tools that accelerate exploration and discovery, amplified by the Al-infused supertools of Human-Centered AI [1].A medical hypertext scenario could enable a physician to provide a patient history, lab tests, and current symptoms as a starting point. The hypertext system could respond with a set of possible diagnoses, which could be selected by the physician, leading to a refined analysis, links to recent clinical trial results, suggestions of consulting specialists, and recommendations for leading treatment centers. The physician could share the analysis with teammates or specialists to get feedback. The physician's exploration records could be saved to the patient's history, so that the treatment plan could be formulated based on reliable resources and then refined by discussions with patients, who would be given links to patient-centered descriptions of the diagnosis and treatment plan. The physician is responsible for what happens, but this scenario provides a strong history for retrospective analyzes of the choices that were made and the outcomes.If human-centered AI design scenarios like this one are oriented to amplifying, augmenting, empowering and enhancing human performance, then the chance of successful outcomes will increase. The passionate advocates of HCAI are devoted to furthering human values, rights, justice, and dignity, by building reliable, safe, and trustworthy systems.The talk will include examples, references to further work, and discussion time for questions. These ideas are drawn from Ben Shneiderman's new book Human-Centered AI [6]. Further information at: https://hcil.umd.edu/human-centered-ai},

abstract={Computerized electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation plays a critical role in the clinical ECG workflow1. Widely available digital ECG data and the algorithmic paradigm of deep learning2 present an opportunity to substantially improve the accuracy and scalability of automated ECG analysis. However, a comprehensive evaluation of an end-to-end deep learning approach for ECG analysis across a wide variety of diagnostic classes has not been previously reported. Here, we develop a deep neural network (DNN) to classify 12 rhythm classes using 91,232 single-lead ECGs from 53,549 patients who used a single-lead ambulatory ECG monitoring device. When validated against an independent test dataset annotated by a consensus committee of board-certified practicing cardiologists, the DNN achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97. The average F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of the positive predictive value and sensitivity, for the DNN (0.837) exceeded that of average cardiologists (0.780). With specificity fixed at the average specificity achieved by cardiologists, the sensitivity of the DNN exceeded the average cardiologist sensitivity for all rhythm classes. These findings demonstrate that an end-to-end deep learning approach can classify a broad range of distinct arrhythmias from single-lead ECGs with high diagnostic performance similar to that of cardiologists. If confirmed in clinical settings, this approach could reduce the rate of misdiagnosed computerized ECG interpretations and improve the efficiency of expert human ECG interpretation by accurately triaging or prioritizing the most urgent conditions.},

abstract={Deep learning algorithms have been used to detect diabetic retinopathy (DR) with specialist-level accuracy. This study aims to validate one such algorithm on a large-scale clinical population, and compare the algorithm performance with that of human graders. A total of 25,326 gradable retinal images of patients with diabetes from the community-based, nationwide screening program of DR in Thailand were analyzed for DR severity and referable diabetic macular edema (DME). Grades adjudicated by a panel of international retinal specialists served as the reference standard. Relative to human graders, for detecting referable DR (moderate NPDR or worse), the deep learning algorithm had significantly higher sensitivity (0.97 vs. 0.74, p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001), and a slightly lower specificity (0.96 vs. 0.98, p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). Higher sensitivity of the algorithm was also observed for each of the categories of severe or worse NPDR, PDR, and DME (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001 for all comparisons). The quadratic-weighted kappa for determination of DR severity levels by the algorithm and human graders was 0.85 and 0.78 respectively (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001 for the difference). Across different severity levels of DR for determining referable disease, deep learning significantly reduced the false negative rate (by 23{\%}) at the cost of slightly higher false positive rates (2{\%}). Deep learning algorithms may serve as a valuable tool for DR screening.},

abstract={Analysis of sleep for the diagnosis of sleep disorders such as Type-1 Narcolepsy (T1N) currently requires visual inspection of polysomnography records by trained scoring technicians. Here, we used neural networks in approximately 3,000 normal and abnormal sleep recordings to automate sleep stage scoring, producing a hypnodensity graph---a probability distribution conveying more information than classical hypnograms. Accuracy of sleep stage scoring was validated in 70 subjects assessed by six scorers. The best model performed better than any individual scorer (87{\%} versus consensus). It also reliably scores sleep down to 5 s instead of 30{\thinspace}s scoring epochs. A T1N marker based on unusual sleep stage overlaps achieved a specificity of 96{\%} and a sensitivity of 91{\%}, validated in independent datasets. Addition of HLA-DQB1*06:02 typing increased specificity to 99{\%}. Our method can reduce time spent in sleep clinics and automates T1N diagnosis. It also opens the possibility of diagnosing T1N using home sleep studies.},

abstract={The ambition of precision medicine is to design and optimize the pathway for diagnosis, therapeutic intervention, and prognosis by using large multidimensional biological datasets that capture individual variability in genes, function and environment. This offers clinicians the opportunity to more carefully tailor early interventions--- whether treatment or preventative in nature---to each individual patient. Taking advantage of high performance computer capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can now achieve reasonable success in predicting risk in certain cancers and cardiovascular disease from available multidimensional clinical and biological data. In contrast, less progress has been made with the neurodevelopmental disorders, which include intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), epilepsy and broader neurodevelopmental disorders. Much hope is pinned on the opportunity to quantify risk from patterns of genomic variation, including the functional characterization of genes and variants, but this ambition is confounded by phenotypic and etiologic heterogeneity, along with the rare and variable penetrant nature of the underlying risk variants identified so far. Structural and functional brain imaging and neuropsychological and neurophysiological markers may provide further dimensionality, but often require more development to achieve sensitivity for diagnosis. Herein, therefore, lies a precision medicine conundrum: can artificial intelligence offer a breakthrough in predicting risks and prognosis for neurodevelopmental disorders? In this review we will examine these complexities, and consider some of the strategies whereby artificial intelligence may overcome them.},

abstract={Aberrant metabolism is the root cause of several serious health issues, creating a huge burden to health and leading to diminished life expectancy. A dysregulated metabolism induces the secretion of several molecules which in turn trigger the inflammatory pathway. Inflammation is the natural reaction of the immune system to a variety of stimuli, such as pathogens, damaged cells, and harmful substances. Metabolically triggered inflammation, also called metaflammation or low-grade chronic inflammation, is the consequence of a synergic interaction between the host and the exposome---a combination of environmental drivers, including diet, lifestyle, pollutants and other factors throughout the life span of an individual. Various levels of chronic inflammation are associated with several lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), cancers, cardiovascular disorders (CVDs), autoimmune diseases, and chronic lung diseases. Chronic diseases are a growing concern worldwide, placing a heavy burden on individuals, families, governments, and health-care systems. New strategies are needed to empower communities worldwide to prevent and treat these diseases. Precision medicine provides a model for the next generation of lifestyle modification. This will capitalize on the dynamic interaction between an individual's biology, lifestyle, behavior, and environment. The aim of precision medicine is to design and improve diagnosis, therapeutics and prognostication through the use of large complex datasets that incorporate individual gene, function, and environmental variations. The implementation of high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) can predict risks with greater accuracy based on available multidimensional clinical and biological datasets. AI-powered precision medicine provides clinicians with an opportunity to specifically tailor early interventions to each individual. In this article, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing and evolving recent, data-driven technologies, such as AI, in preventing, treating and reversing lifestyle-related diseases.},

In this paper, we propose and evaluate two kinds of example-based explanations in the visual domain, normative explanations and comparative explanations (Figure 1), which automatically surface examples from the training set of a deep neural net sketch-recognition algorithm. To investigate their effects, we deployed these explanations to 1150 users on QuickDraw, an online platform where users draw images and see whether a recognizer has correctly guessed the intended drawing. When the algorithm failed to recognize the drawing, those who received normative explanations felt they had a better understanding of the system, and perceived the system to have higher capability. However, comparative explanations did not always improve perceptions of the algorithm, possibly because they sometimes exposed limitations of the algorithm and may have led to surprise. These findings suggest that examples can serve as a vehicle for explaining algorithmic behavior, but point to relative advantages and disadvantages of using different kinds of examples, depending on the goal.},

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in image retrieval systems for medical decision making. One application of ML is to retrieve visually similar medical images from past patients (e.g. tissue from biopsies) to reference when making a medical decision with a new patient. However, no algorithm can perfectly capture an expert's ideal notion of similarity for every case: an image that is algorithmically determined to be similar may not be medically relevant to a doctor's specific diagnostic needs. In this paper, we identified the needs of pathologists when searching for similar images retrieved using a deep learning algorithm, and developed tools that empower users to cope with the search algorithm on-the-fly, communicating what types of similarity are most important at different moments in time. In two evaluations with pathologists, we found that these tools increased the diagnostic utility of images found and increased user trust in the algorithm. The tools were preferred over a traditional interface, without a loss in diagnostic accuracy. We also observed that users adopted new strategies when using refinement tools, re-purposing them to test and understand the underlying algorithm and to disambiguate ML errors from their own errors. Taken together, these findings inform future human-ML collaborative systems for expert decision-making.},

In this paper, a completely integrated CAD system is proposed to screen digital X-ray mammograms involving detection, segmentation, and classification of breast masses via deep learning methodologies. In this work, to detect breast mass from entire mammograms, You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO), a regional deep learning approach, is used. To segment the mass, full resolution convolutional network (FrCN), a new deep network model, is proposed and utilized. Finally, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to recognize the mass and classify it as either benign or malignant. To evaluate the proposed integrated CAD system in terms of the accuracies of detection, segmentation, and classification, the publicly available and annotated INbreast database was utilized. The evaluation results of the proposed CAD system via four-fold cross-validation tests show that a mass detection accuracy of 98.96\%, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 97.62\%, and F1-score of 99.24\% are achieved with the INbreast dataset. Moreover, the mass segmentation results via FrCN produced an overall accuracy of 92.97\%, MCC of 85.93\%, and Dice (F1-score) of 92.69\% and Jaccard similarity coefficient metrics of 86.37\%, respectively. The detected and segmented masses were classified via CNN and achieved an overall accuracy of 95.64\%, AUC of 94.78\%, MCC of 89.91\%, and F1-score of 96.84\%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that the proposed CAD system, through all stages of detection, segmentation, and classification, outperforms the latest conventional deep learning methodologies. Our proposed CAD system could be used to assist radiologists in all stages of detection, segmentation, and classification of breast masses.}

A correct assessment of avalanche danger and following a correct decision is crucial. This requires a thorough evaluation of a range of factors. To aid these decisions several decision-making frameworks (DMF) have been put forward. However, actual use of these frameworks and their underlying factors can be questioned. We asked 100 experts about their familiarity and usage of the DMFs and their underlying factors. We found a large discrepancy between familiarity with and actual use of the most commonly used DMFs. In contrast to most frameworks that have a probabilistic approach, experts primarily use an analytical one. We also found that experts use more factors and emphasize other factors than most DMFs do. Indeed, the factors the experts use do not match any of the DMFs well, with the agreement ranging from 56\% to 73\%. Factors seen as core in many frameworks, such as the combination of danger level and slope inclination, are by a large margin the least used of all the terrain factors among the experts. We found a void between the existing frameworks and how – and on what basis – experts make their decisions. Our findings raise a fundamental question: How, when and where do the transition from novice to expert occur? Future initiatives to revise or develop new decision-making frameworks should take into account what experts use.}

This property not only helps doctors understand their decisions, but also allows less experienced practitioners to improve their knowledge. Skin cancer diagnosis is a field where explainability is of critical importance, as lesions of different classes often exhibit confounding characteristics. This work proposes a deep neural network (DNN) for skin cancer diagnosis that provides explainability through content-based image retrieval. We explore several state-of-the-art approaches to improve the feature space learned by the DNN, namely contrastive, distillation, and triplet losses. We demonstrate that the combination of these regularization losses with the categorical cross-entropy leads to the best performances on melanoma classification, and results in a hybrid DNN that simultaneously: i) classifies the images; and ii) retrieves similar images justifying the diagnosis.

abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a field of computer science aimed to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence. Currently, AI is recognized in the broader technology radar within the five key technologies which emerge for their wide-ranging applications and impact in communities, companies, business, and value chain framework alike. However, AI in medical imaging is at an early phase of development, and there are still hurdles to take related to reliability, user confidence, and adoption. The present narrative review aimed to provide an overview on AI-based approaches (distributed learning, statistical learning, computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems, fully automated image analysis tool, natural language processing) in oncological hybrid medical imaging with respect to clinical tasks (detection, contouring and segmentation, prediction of histology and tumor stage, prediction of mutational status and molecular therapies targets, prediction of treatment response, and outcome). Particularly, AI-based approaches have been briefly described according to their purpose and, finally lung cancer---being one of the most extensively malignancy studied by hybrid medical imaging---has been used as illustrative scenario. Finally, we discussed clinical challenges and open issues including ethics, validation strategies, effective data-sharing methods, regulatory hurdles, educational resources, and strategy to facilitate the interaction among different stakeholders. Some of the major changes in medical imaging will come from the application of AI to workflow and protocols, eventually resulting in improved patient management and quality of life. Overall, several time-consuming tasks could be automatized. Machine learning algorithms and neural networks will permit sophisticated analysis resulting not only in major improvements in disease characterization through imaging, but also in the integration of multiple-omics data (i.e., derived from pathology, genomic, proteomics, and demographics) for multi-dimensional disease featuring. Nevertheless, to accelerate the transition of the theory to practice a sustainable development plan considering the multi-dimensional interactions between professionals, technology, industry, markets, policy, culture, and civil society directed by a mindset which will allow talents to thrive is necessary.},

abstract={Medical imaging plays a fundamental role in oncology and drug development, by providing a non-invasive method to visualize tumor phenotype. Radiomics can quantify this phenotype comprehensively by applying image-characterization algorithms, and may provide important information beyond tumor size or burden. In this study, we investigated if radiomics can identify a gefitinib response-phenotype, studying high-resolution computed-tomography (CT) imaging of forty-seven patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer before and after three weeks of therapy. On the baseline-scan, radiomic-feature Laws-Energy was significantly predictive for EGFR-mutation status (AUC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.67, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.03), while volume (AUC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.59, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.27) and diameter (AUC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.56, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.46) were not. Although no features were predictive on the post-treatment scan (p{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}0.08), the change in features between the two scans was strongly predictive (significant feature AUC-range{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.74--0.91). A technical validation revealed that the associated features were also highly stable for test-retest (mean{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}std: ICC{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.96{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.06). This pilot study shows that radiomic data before treatment is able to predict mutation status and associated gefitinib response non-invasively, demonstrating the potential of radiomics-based phenotyping to improve the stratification and response assessment between tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) sensitive and resistant patient populations.},

abstract = {The brain disorders may cause loss of some critical functions such as thinking, speech, and movement. So, the early detection of brain diseases may help to get the timely best treatment. One of the conventional methods used to diagnose these disorders is the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. Manual diagnosis of brain abnormalities is time-consuming and difficult to perceive the minute changes in the MRI images, especially in the early stages of abnormalities. Proper selection of the features and classifiers to obtain the highest performance is a challenging task. Hence, deep learning models have been widely used for medical image analysis over the past few years. In this study, we have employed the AlexNet, Vgg-16, ResNet-18, ResNet-34, and ResNet-50 pre-trained models to automatically classify MR images in to normal, cerebrovascular, neoplastic, degenerative, and inflammatory diseases classes. We have also compared their classification performance with pre-trained models, which are the state-of-art architectures. We have obtained the best classification accuracy of 95.23\% ± 0.6 with the ResNet-50 model among the five pre-trained models. Our model is ready to be tested with huge MRI images of brain abnormalities. The outcome of the model will also help the clinicians to validate their findings after manual reading of the MRI images.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown lead to the rapid adoption and use of various groupware applications ("apps'') for remote connection with colleagues, friends, and family. Different factors such as user experiences, trust, and social influences ("user-situational motivations'') were instrumental in determining how and what apps people adopted and used, especially at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this empirical study, we examine how these factors and four predominant user-situational motivations (i.e., the mandated use of an app by an employer/institution, recommended use of an app by an employer/institution, recommended use of an app by a peer(s), and self-selection of an app) influenced the rapid adoption and use of groupware applications. Specifically, we develop an "emergency adoption model" of groupware applications using 195 valid survey responses to highlight the factors that motivated these apps' use at the onset of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. We leverage the Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and integrate it with the users' past use of the application before the COVID-19 lockdown, user-situational motivation, and their privacy-related trust in the application provider to develop a more comprehensive model. Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), we find that the users who used a groupware app in the past continued to use it, and in line with TAM, users' intention to adopt and use a groupware application was largely driven by the ease-of-use and usefulness of the app. Furthermore, while not a part of the traditional TAM model, we find that privacy-related trust in the application provider plays an important role in emergency adoption. However, unlike typical adoption models, the nature of all these effects---most prominently those related to privacy-related trust---depend on the underlying situational motivation. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest ways to improve the adoption and use of groupware applications, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {As automation becomes more prevalent, the fear of job loss due to automation increases [22]. Workers may not be amenable to working with a robotic co-worker due to a negative perception of the technology. The attitudes of workers towards automation are influenced by a variety of complex and multi-faceted factors such as intention to use, perceived usefulness and other external variables [15]. In an analog manufacturing environment, we explore how these various factors influence an individual's willingness to work with a robot over a human co-worker in a collaborative Lego building task. We specifically explore how this willingness is affected by: 1) the level of social rapport established between the individual and his or her human co-worker, 2) the anthropomorphic qualities of the robot, and 3) factors including trust, fluency and personality traits. Our results show that a participant's willingness to work with automation decreased due to lower perceived team fluency (p=0.045), rapport established between a participant and their co-worker (p=0.003), the gender of the participant being male (p=0.041), and a higher inherent trust in people (p=0.018).},

    abstract = { Populationwide mammography screening has been associated with a substantial rise in false-positive mammography findings and breast cancer overdiagnosis. However, there is a lack of current data on the associated costs in the United States. We present costs due to false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses among women ages 40–59, based on expenditure data from a major US health care insurance plan for 702,154 women in the years 2011–13. The average expenditures for each false-positive mammogram, invasive breast cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ in the twelve months following diagnosis were \$852, \$51,837 and \$12,369, respectively. This translates to a national cost of \$4 billion each year. The costs associated with false-positive mammograms and breast cancer overdiagnoses appear to be much higher than previously documented. Screening has the potential to save lives. However, the economic impact of false-positive mammography results and breast cancer overdiagnoses must be considered in the debate about the appropriate populations for screening. }

abstract={Mammographic tumour appearance may provide prognostic useful information. For example, spiculation indicates invasiveness, but also better survival compared to tumours with other appearances. We aimed to study the relationship between mammographic tumour appearance and established clinicopathological factors, including surrogate molecular breast cancer subtypes, in the large Malm{\"o} Diet and Cancer Study. A total of 1116 women with invasive breast cancer, diagnosed between 1991 and 2014, were included. Mammographic tumour appearance in relation to status for oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, histological grade, Ki67 and molecular subtype was analysed using various regression models. All models were adjusted for relevant confounders, including breast density, which can affect mammographic appearance. The results consistently showed that spiculated tumours are indicative of favourable characteristics, as they are more likely to be ER and PR positive, and more often exhibit lower histological grade and lower Ki67 expression. Furthermore, spiculated tumours tend to be of luminal A-like subtype, which is associated with a good prognosis. The establishment of associations between mammographic tumour appearance and clinico­pathological factors may aid in characterizing breast cancer at an earlier stage. This could contribute to more individualized breast cancer treatment in the future.},

abstract="The need for explainability of AI algorithms has been identified in the literature for some time now. However, recently became even more important due to new data protection act rules (GDPR 2018) and due to the requirements for wider applicability of AI to several application areas. BT's autonomics team has recognized this through several sources and identified the vitality of AI algorithms explainability to ensure their adoption and commercialization. In this paper, we designed and developed a system providing explanations for a prediction of patient readmittance using machine learning. The requirements and the evaluation were set by BT through their projects with real-customers in the medical domain. A logistic regression machine learning algorithm was implemented with explainability ``hooks'' embedded in its code and the corresponding interfaces to the users of the system were implemented through a web interface. Python-based technologies were utilized for the implementation of the algorithm (Scikit-learn) and the web interface (web2py), and the system was evaluated through thorough testing and feedback. Initial trade-off analysis of such an approach that presents the overhead introduced by adding explainability versus the benefits was performed. Lastly, conclusions and future work are presented, considering experimentation with more algorithms and application of software engineering methods such as abstraction to the aid of explainable AI, leading further along to ``explainability by design''.",

    abstract = { Axillary lymph node (LN) metastasis is the most important predictor of overall recurrence and survival in patients with breast cancer, and accurate assessment of axillary LN involvement is an essential component in staging breast cancer. Axillary management in patients with breast cancer has become much less invasive and individualized with the introduction of sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB). Emerging evidence indicates that axillary LN dissection may be avoided in selected patients with node-positive as well as node-negative cancer. Thus, assessment of nodal disease burden to guide multidisciplinary treatment decision making is now considered to be a critical role of axillary imaging and can be achieved with axillary US, MRI, and US-guided biopsy. For the node-positive patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, restaging of the axilla with US and MRI and targeted axillary dissection in addition to SLNB is highly recommended to minimize the false-negative rate of SLNB. Efforts continue to develop prediction models that incorporate imaging features to predict nodal disease burden and to select proper candidates for SLNB. As methods of axillary nodal evaluation evolve, breast radiologists and surgeons must work closely to maximize the potential role of imaging and to provide the most optimized treatment for patients. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article. }

Breast imaging has the most common cause of organ-related misdiagnosis subject to malpractice suits. In order to effectively develop strategies to prevent errors, breast imaging radiologists must first understand the underlying causes of the errors that occur in the breast imaging setting. Errors in breast imaging can be related to errors in interpretation, improper workup of imaging findings, procedural errors, or errors in communication to the patient or other medical staff. The Yorkshire contributory factors framework was developed to identify factors that contribute to the errors in a hospital setting and can be adapted for use in the breast imaging setting. Within this framework, active failures refer to errors that directly affect the patient. Active errors include slips (including biases), lapses, and mistakes. The framework describes how active errors often result from factors that occur uphill from these active errors at different levels within the system. Once error causes are understood, there are concrete strategies and tools that breast imaging radiologists can implement to decrease adverse events, reduce medical errors, and promote a safety environment in the breast imaging clinic. Error mitigation tools can be summarized using the acronym SAFE, which includes support the team, ask questions, focus on a task, and effectively communicate/ensure equipment optimization/safe environment. Knowledge of errors commonly seen in a breast imaging clinic represent an opportunity for constructive changes and, ultimately, improved health care delivery.}",

The dataset is the slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset provided by Kaggle competition, which packs the clinically-relevant task of metastasis detection into a straight-forward binary image classification task.

In this study, we propose a new network, namely KimiaNet, that employs the topology of the DenseNet with four dense blocks, fine-tuned and trained with histopathology images in different configurations. We used more than 240,000 image patches with 1000×1000 pixels acquired at 20× magnification through our proposed “high-cellularity mosaic” approach to enable the usage of weak labels of 7126 whole slide images of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human pathology samples publicly available through The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) repository. We tested KimiaNet using three public datasets, namely TCGA, endometrial cancer images, and colorectal cancer images by evaluating the performance of search and classification when corresponding features of different networks are used for image representation. As well, we designed and trained multiple convolutional batch-normalized ReLU (CBR) networks. The results show that KimiaNet provides superior results compared to the original DenseNet and smaller CBR networks when used as feature extractor to represent histopathology images.}

abstract="The urban environment is becoming increasingly more connected and complex. In the coming decades, we will be surrounded by billions of sensors, devices, and machines, the Internet of Things (IoT). As the world becomes more connected, we will become dependent on machines to make decisions on our behalf. When machines use data from sensors, devices, and other machines (i.e., things) to make decisions, they need to learn how to trustTrust that data, as well as the things they are interacting with. As cyber physical systems become more commonplace in IoT and smart citySmart city applications, it is essential that decision makers are able to trustTrust the machines making decisions on their behalf. This chapter defines trustTrust from a multidimensional perspective, which includes reliabilityReliability. It describes a set of research projects conducted that span the multiple dimensions of trustTrust. While the research described spans a range of trustTrust topics, little has been done on the relevance of trustTrust to simulation. Simulations that use and interact with real-world systems is growing, which means understanding their trustworthinessTrustworthiness is of growing importance. The chapter concludes with a few ideas on a research agenda for the way forward.",

abstract="Background: Patient monitoring is indispensable in any operating room to follow the patient's current health state based on measured physiological parameters. Reducing workload helps to free cognitive resources and thus influences human performance, which ultimately improves the quality of care. Among the many methods available to assess perceived workload, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) provides the most widely accepted tool. However, only few studies have investigated the validity of the NASA-TLX in the health care sector. Objective: This study aimed to validate a modified version of the raw NASA-TLX in patient monitoring tasks by investigating its correspondence with expected lower and higher workload situations and its robustness against nonworkload-related covariates. This defines criterion validity. Methods: In this pooled analysis, we evaluated raw NASA-TLX scores collected after performing patient monitoring tasks in four different investigator-initiated, computer-based, prospective, multicenter studies. All of them were conducted in three hospitals with a high standard of care in central Europe. In these already published studies, we compared conventional patient monitoring with two newly developed situation awareness--oriented monitoring technologies called Visual Patient and Visual Clot. The participants were resident and staff anesthesia and intensive care physicians, and nurse anesthetists with completed specialization qualification. We analyzed the raw NASA-TLX scores by fitting mixed linear regression models and univariate models with different covariates. Results: We assessed a total of 1160 raw NASA-TLX questionnaires after performing specific patient monitoring tasks. Good test performance and higher self-rated diagnostic confidence correlated significantly with lower raw NASA-TLX scores and the subscores (all P<.001). Staff physicians rated significantly lower workload scores than residents (P=.001), whereas nurse anesthetists did not show any difference in the same comparison (P=.83). Standardized distraction resulted in higher rated total raw NASA-TLX scores (P<.001) and subscores. There was no gender difference regarding perceived workload (P=.26). The new visualization technologies Visual Patient and Visual Clot resulted in significantly lower total raw NASA-TLX scores and all subscores, including high self-rated performance, when compared with conventional monitoring (all P<.001). Conclusions: This study validated a modified raw NASA-TLX questionnaire for patient monitoring tasks. The scores obtained correctly represented the assumed influences of the examined covariates on the perceived workload. We reported high criterion validity. The NASA-TLX questionnaire appears to be a reliable tool for measuring subjective workload. Further research should focus on its applicability in a clinical setting. ",
