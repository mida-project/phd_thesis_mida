\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:chap001001}

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in women~\cite{https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21754}.
However, early detection and treatment can considerably improve results~\cite{doi:10.1002/cncr.32859}.
Consequently, large-scale screening programs are implemented worldwide.
Most medical and governmental organizations recommend screening for all women between 40 and 50 of age~\cite{https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21754}.
The annual incidence of over 400,000 new female cases in Europe~\cite{Dafni2019} underscores the pressing requirement.
Therefore, efficient screening and diagnostic methods are essential in addressing this challenge.

Despite the extensive adoption of screening exams, interpreting these images remains challenging.
The accuracy achieved by clinical experts in cancer detection varies widely (Figure~\ref{fig:fig114}), and the performance of even the best clinicians leaves room for improvement~\cite{10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.5231}.
For instance, the \acp{FP}\footnotemark[1] can lead to the anxiety of the patient~\cite{10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.981}, avoidable follow-ups, and unnecessary procedures of invasive diagnostics.
On the other hand, the \acp{FN}\footnotemark[2] are even more severe, since the exam misdiagnoses a patient who has the disease~\cite{doi:10.1056/NEJMe1912943}.
During the screening phase, the missing cancers may not be identified until they are more advanced and less agreeable to treatment~\cite{Houssami2017}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\footnotetext[1]{False-Positive: when the screening result looks abnormal even though no cancer is actually present. Abnormal screening results often require extra testing to determine if the change is cancer. The FP results are more common in younger women, who have dense breasts, have had breast biopsies, have breast cancer in the family, or are taking estrogen.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\footnotetext[2]{False-Negative: when the screening result looks normal even though breast cancer is present. Women with dense breasts are likelier to get FN results. The FN cases can give women a false sense of security, thinking that they donâ€™t have breast cancer, when in fact, they do.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The integration of \ac{AI} in medical imaging workflows presents a unique opportunity to address this challenge~\cite{McKinney2020}, leveraging technologies such as {\it radiomics}, \ac{CADe}, \ac{CADx}, \acp{CDSSe} inside the \ac{RRR}.
Extensive research has demonstrated the potential of \ac{AI} to achieve or even surpass human performance in various clinical tasks, offering promising avenues for enhancing healthcare delivery\cite{Topol2019}.
Given the global shortage of medical professionals, which threatens the adequacy and accessibility of clinical services, the scalability of \ac{AI} solutions holds the potential to elevate the standard of care and bridge the gap in healthcare provision~\cite{McKinney2020, Topol2019}.

Approximately 1 in 2 women have dense breasts, while dense breasts have 50\% chance of missing a cancer. FPs in breast screening are quite common, with around 90\% of women who are called back for further exams after a MG not having cancer. Additionally, about 10\% of breast cancers are underclassified or misclassified as negative (FN) when they are actually positive, which can have serious consequences for patients.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In the medical imaging domains, \ac{AI} has the potential to improve visual diagnostic accuracy~\cite{Tschandl2020}.
\ac{AI}-based triage and decision support could assist readers, such as radiologists, in managing clinical workflows and improving their performance~\cite{McKinney2020}.
Most recent works have been predicted on comparisons of the diagnostic accuracy of \ac{AI} systems with clinicians~\cite{He2019, 10.1145/3313831.3376290}.
Furthermore, recent studies, in breast cancer, demonstrate that \ac{AI} for diagnosis is equivalent or even superior to human experts in medical imaging under experimental conditions~\cite{Ribli2018, McKinney2020}.
This competitive view of \ac{AI} is evolving based on studies suggesting that a more promising approach is an \ac{HAII}~\cite{10.1145/3313831.3376807, 10.1145/3313831.3376301}, with techniques that improve the interaction between humans and machines.

The role of \ac{HAII} in healthcare delivery and its impact on the quality of care, as well as the appropriate settings in which it can be applied, are critical areas that require evaluation~\cite{Tschandl2020}.
Furthermore, in the context of \ac{DL} models, the `black box' nature of these models raises concerns regarding the transparency and interpretability of their decisions~\cite{9473208}.
To address this challenge, it is essential to understand the underlying representations and explanations generated by these models, as this knowledge is crucial for instilling trust and fostering acceptance among healthcare professionals and patients~\cite{10.1145/3544548.3581075, EVANS2022281}.
Although researchers have made attempts to study the effects of \ac{HAII} across different clinical workflows and levels of medical expertise~\cite{doi:10.1148/radiol.2019182627}, there is still a lack of understanding regarding personalized and customized \ac{AI} recommendations.
The final objective of this thesis is to address this gap by adapting \ac{AI} recommendations to various representations and explanations generated by \ac{DL}-based classifiers, an area that has not been extensively explored.
This involves using anthropomorphic intelligent agents with human-like qualities, behaviors, and characteristics.
In our dissertation, these intelligent agents act as second readers, offering diagnostic support and emulating clinicians' reasoning.
Therefore, this research gap presents an open opportunity for investigation, serving as the motivation behind the proposed research in this thesis.

\section{Research View}
\label{sec:chap001002}

Our work aims to enhance clinicians' understanding and acceptance of \ac{AI} systems by leveraging recent advancements in \ac{DL} methods and studying their applicability across different levels of medical expertise and clinical workflows.
In Section~\ref{sec:chap001002001}, we provide a detailed overview of the specific areas that our dissertation will encompass.
Following that, in Section~\ref{sec:chap001002002}, we outline the main objectives for each chapter of the dissertation.
Together, these sections intertwine to establish a robust foundation as the fundamental bedrock for our comprehensive investigation, providing essential support and guidance to our dissertation thesis.

\subsection{Research Scope}
\label{sec:chap001002001}

This dissertation delves into the design, development, and assessment of novel \ac{AI}-based visual representations, particularly in medical imaging diagnosis (Section~\ref{sec:chap002001}).
The work builds on recent advancements in the accuracy of \ac{DL} methods~\cite{9098470}, studying their utility across various levels of medical expertise and numerous clinical workflows (Section~\ref{sec:chap002002}).
Despite the potential to assist clinicians, challenges persist, namely the scarcity of available, curated medical data~\cite{10.1145/3313831.3376290}, and the opacity of \ac{AI} decision-making processes~\cite{Yue_2020_CVPR}.
To counter these, the thesis proposes a dual approach:
(1) developing a {\it framework} to support the visualization of clinical findings provided by \ac{DL} methods for severity classification of a patient (Section~\ref{sec:chap002003}); and
(2) enhancing clinicians' comprehension about \ac{AI} algorithmic results through granular explanations of the medical data, for instance, informing the lesion typification (Section~\ref{sec:chap002004}) that will clarify the severity of that patient.
While considering this process within the workflow context (Section~\ref{sec:chap002005}), the dissertation also recognizes the importance of rendering multi-modal images\footnotemark[3] and other \ac{AI} techniques (Section~\ref{sec:chap002006}).
Ultimately, the thesis advocates for a user-centric intelligent agent that mimics human reasoning, despite certain complexities (Section~\ref{sec:chap002007} and Section~\ref{sec:chap002008}), to facilitate a more straightforward interpretation of the \ac{DL} outcomes for clinicians.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\footnotetext[3]{Multimodality: in this thesis, a diagnostic technique for the patient treatment: (1) \ac{MG}, both \ac{CC} and \ac{MLO} views; (2) \ac{US}; (3) \ac{MRI}; and (4) text. The considered text modalities are, for instance, report information, personal history, family history, and age, among others.}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The primary objective of this dissertation is to make a meaningful contribution to the intersection of \ac{HCI} and \ac{AI} in medical systems by tackling existing challenges (Section~\ref{sec:chap003001}) and harnessing the possibilities offered by anthropomorphic intelligent agents in the context of medical imaging diagnosis.
Through the application of \ac{UCD} principles and the utilization of methodologies such as user research, usability testing, and cognitive task analysis, the thesis strives to improve the user-friendliness, efficacy, and transparency of \ac{AI} systems in medicine.
The overarching objective is to develop \ac{AI} solutions that effectively address the requirements of healthcare professionals and enhance the diagnostic process in medical imaging.

In this dissertation, five scientific problems were addressed: (1) mitigating the bias between the clinical background of the medical imaging workflow and the related work of intelligent agents among the research communities; (2) understanding the factors influencing AI acceptance and adoption of intelligent agents in medical imaging diagnosis; (3) addressing clinicians' needs and preferences through design interventions that prioritize a human-centered approach to integrate DL models into real-world clinical workflows; (4) supporting evidence for effectively personalize and customize the explanations of intelligent agents based on the behavioral characteristics of clinicians with varying levels of medical expertise; and (5) discussing conclusive recommendations and principles raised from our findings.}
\label{fig:fig115}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Several contributions are solving each problem challenge addressed in this thesis (Figure~\ref{fig:fig115}).
Although this dissertation focuses on the main goals and contributions of the thesis, a critical objective is to provide information concerning the medical imaging background and review of the literature for \ac{HCI} related work.
For problem one (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap002}, Chapter~\ref{chap:chap003} and Appendix~\ref{chap:app001}), we aim to improve the understating of clinicians, researchers, engineers, and policymakers in developing robust and effective user-centric interventions across the breast cancer domain.
Moreover, problem two (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap004} and Appendix~\ref{chap:app002}) seeks light on the adoption and acceptance of intelligent agents in the context of the medical imaging workflow.
In problem three (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap005}, Appendix~\ref{chap:app003}, and Appendix~\ref{chap:app004}), we prioritize a human-centered approach to address clinicians' needs and preferences on the integration of \ac{DL} models into real-world clinical workflows through design interventions.
From here, it highlights the clinicians' requirements for functionality improvements and effective communication of the intelligent agents (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap006} and Appendix~\ref{chap:app005}), considering the need for personalizing and customizing \ac{AI} recommendations of problem four.
Ultimately, we discuss and conclude our final remarks on problem five (Chapter~\ref{chap:chap007} and Chapter~\ref{chap:chap008}), while providing design recommendations and principles from our findings.
